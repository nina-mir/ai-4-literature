        "text": "Art by Ronald Lockett Photos by Cary Whittier, courtesy of MARCH On Saturday June 10, at 3:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time, please join a dozen of Bo Huston's friends and colleagues (old and new) to  celebrate Bo's birthday . He would have been sixty-four. For two hours, we'll share memories of Bo and read out loud from his work. The event is free and open to the public.  Click here  to join. Updates and more information about the event are available on Twitter  @fellowseries  or Instagram  @fellowtravelersseries . There must not be a Jed. Is the last sentence of  an imperative? Is it a Thou shall not forbidding Jed from existing? Forbidding Holly from forming Jed? Who is forbidding what?  Or is the sentence a speculation? Is Holly wondering if there is or was no Jed? Or at least as Holly has imagined him? Or as Jed has presented himself to us?  The sentence before was: Im lost.  Of course Hollys lost. We are lost, but somewhere bigger than we imagined when we started. Where are you now? How long have you been wrong? You cannot just be nowhere. We are lost because these sentences work like puns or optical illusions, like the one where first you see the vase then you see the two facing profiles but you cant see both at once even though you know theyre both there, so which is the real one and what is the other? A dream? Sometimes in writing things can be how they cant in life because anything can be the way you tell it.  These sentences are also somewhat what love is like. How it can make you your most alive self, but also make you not quite yourself, because youre beside yourself then, a subset of who you love. Sometimes it makes you a friend or colleague but sometimes you get obsessed, deluded, vexed. You do things you didnt dream before and dont care what anyone thinks. You only think of the one you love. Whoever you were before is lost.  These sentences come in the last section of   at the end of Hollys narration of a dream hes had when asleep. Holly dreams he is walking across a field where he is hoping to meet Jed. But in this dream, the person he meets isnt Jed, doesnt know him, walks past and leaves Holly alone. Sometimes even in dreams you cant get what you want. Sometimes even love leaves you alone.  If youre someone who doesnt fit right into the world, if how youre seen in the world is diseased and dangerous, why not live in a dream?  The first line of   is Prologue or epilogue. But the story also begins in the middle, when Holly and Jed have just landed in L.A. and are about to get in a car to head out across the US, kind of like Huck and Jim, and Sal and Dean after them. Theyre in a bright, wide, huge-windowed airport, and a woman in front of them starts coughing, then a male-female couple is coughing too, then everyone is coughing and trying to run away like a scene of a plague. Holly is terrified, Jed isnt. Jed sees Holly like this: His eyes were red, his lips were apart and whitish. It was like his skin had been stripped off him. Holly thinks theyre being gassed but Jed is thinking about Holly: I hadnt ever seen him so scared, actually, not in such a sudden way, so fragile. Id never seen an adult seem so much like a child. Jed smiles, I guess like an adult would smile to calm down a worried kid.  But theirs were not boyhoods in which kindly parents smiled to calm scared children down. This is a book about children growing up without parents who know how to love, about boys becoming men, and men becoming old and trying to grasp at what they didnt get when young. There arent any fathers to speak of in this book, and the mothers dont know how to mother their kids, though Holly would be a mother if he could. This book is about being in the world not rightly made. I remember a friend of mine in the late 80s telling me his father had been repulsed by his being gay. The father called his son deficient. My friend could not forget that word, even after his father came around to love him. A lot of us old homos from 30, 40, 50 years ago cannot forget what was said to us and thought of us. It still burns inside us.  Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1990, oil, enamel, metal, plastic fencing, branches on wood, 48 x 71 1/2 x 1/2 inches Can someone rescue someone from the world? Maybe themselves? What if the way you are in the world is wrong? Do you look for someone else like you? Do you dream them into life? Can such a dream last?  The second line of   is: And keep the story simple. The plot of this story is simple: a man goes to a cafe and remembers his life. He goes there in the afternoons and tries to avoid the embarrassing old queens who frequent the place. He regards himself, like them, as old: I no longer feel dangerous. That was a thing of youth. Holly is only in his early thirties (about the age Bo Huston was when he was wrote this book), but his body feels old because hes sick. Theres something wrong with his eyes and he coughs all time. Somethings gone terribly wrong, deep inside... a cruel unfathomable sickness. It goes back to his childhood.  When does a child understand theyre different? When do they understand they are not loved? Whats wrong with them?  When news about what was variously referred to as gay cancer, the gay plague, GRID (Gay Related Immune Disorder), began appearing in the American press in 1981, many Americans accepted this as proof that being gay meant being sick. The term AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), which came into use in l982, might have done away with the gay = sick equation, but it didnt. Large parts of America and the world continued to revile gay men and to regard AIDS as an illness those perverts deserved.  Bo Huston was diagnosed with AIDS in l988. He quit his job in advertising and spent the remainder of his life writing and working for other writers. He was a regular columnist for the San Francisco   and a co-founder of Out/Write, the first LGBTQ literary conference. He wrote four books.  He wrote about people who were reviledjunkies and shut-ins and broken-down queens, wives whose husbands have left them, husbands whose wives have left. Murderers, hustlers, the self-deluded, mothers whose babies died, and convalescents. Hustons first two books,   (1990), and   (l991), a novel, were published by Amethyst Press, a small press specializing in work by out gay men. Back in the 80s and early 90s it was rare for out LGBT writers to get their work published by mainstream houses or reviewed by the mainstream press. Our stories, back then, were mostly reviled too.  The horse of   is both heroin (Bo had been an addict and had gotten clean) and a childs toy. There are a few pieces in   that are clearly the work of a young writer trying out different voices and formal experiments with varying degrees of success. But much of the collection is powerful and accomplished. One of the stories I cant stop thinking about is Seven Kinds of Pity. I wont summarize the whole story here, other than to tell you that the main character, Witthauer, has just been abandoned by his wife. This is the final paragraph:  It is not really that Witthauer is generous or forgiving, but that he feels nothing now but pity. That pity he feels for his wife, that which she feels for him, she for herself, he for himself, pity the whole world would feel for Witthauer and he for the whole world. If the truth were really known and could be told.  Its hard to write about pity without being maudlin. Its hard to write about sentiment without being sentimental. Its also not worth writing unless you risk those things.  In The Divine Image, William Blake wrote of Mercy, Pity, Peace and Love. These four are God, Blake says, these four are also humanity. Of the four, though, Pity has a human face. Bo Huston looked at his characters with mercy and love, and very much with pity.  Holly looked sad, weak. And when he looked that way it was so easy for me to just forget my own side of things, to feel... I guess its sympathy. Pity, maybe? Maybe what people think is love is really just pity.  ( )  Can anyone really help who they are? Can anyone ever change? Can anyone take away someone elses pain? Does anyone not need pity?  Bo Huston seems to have a godlike compassion for his characters. He sees them as imperfect human beings who have suffered or caused others suffering, yet are still capable of redemption.  Another of the stories in Horse, Little World, reappears as the first chapter of Remember Me. I know that death is a rumor. I pay it no mind, it begins, but illness, death and AIDS appear throughout this book. The first person narrator and his invalid shut-in housemate, Charlotte, try to live as separately from the world as they can and protect each other from it. As with Holly and Jed, though, their relationship becomes too insular and cannot be sustained.   (St Martins Press, l993) was published posthumously. This is a book that, for years, my wife would buy every copy we came across (it went out of print a while ago) to keep to give people. I assigned it to my smartest, most passionate students. I find this collection utterly heartbreaking and maybe flawless. I dont know of much more earth-aware and yet transcendent fiction.  In the penultimate section of  , before Holly has his dream, he recounts an event from childhood that shaped me, the source of all my meaty trouble, the origin of my sickness ...  Aunt Joy (what a hopeful name!) has brought his mother home from the hospital. Shes had a mental breakdown and no longer knows her son. Jeds mother is a mess in a different way. Early in  , Holly asks:  Who were we? Teacher and pupil, master and slave, or friends? Fagin and Oliver Twist? Lovers? We were certainly not like a father and son... Was that what Jed wanted? (In my deepest, most honest dreams, I was his mother.)  A paragraph later Holly confesses: I miss Jed with that saddest kind of grief; the way I miss my own childhood, my own self.  These mothers loved their sons the way they could. What happened to them? Can a man love a child like a mother? Can a child let a male mother him?  What do you look for when you look for love? Who decides what is love and what isnt? What if love isnt enough? What if it is?  Ronald Lockett,  , 1997, enamel on metal, wood panel, 48 x 48 x 2 inches I met Bo in San Francisco when I was there to promote my book,  , which City Lights published in the US. Id been living in Europe for several years and when I came back to the states in 1990 I didnt know many American writers and had little idea what was happening in LGBT writing. Amy Scholder, my editor at City Lights (God bless Amy Scholder!!!), arranged for me to meet Bo. I think one of us was supposed to be interviewing the other but maybe that was just an excuse to get us together. I remember feeling intimidated and somewhat shy around this particularly sharp guy. He had strong opinions about the work of our contemporaries, and thought a lot of it was slight. I didnt know most of the work or the people who wrote it, so I wasnt so shocked by his dismissals. I did, though, know and love some of the same classic writers he did. (Think of all those references, in  , to Thomas Mann, E. M. Forster, Lewis Carroll, Willa Cather, Charles Dickens. We loved those guys and gals, though we disagreed about Gertrude Stein.) We also both totally loved Yeats. In Ireland a couple years before, I had bought a T-shirt with a picture of Yeats on it. This impressed Bo terrifically, for which I was and remain glad.  Bo and I kept in touch and talked about writing and books and writers we liked and hated and AIDS and death and God and love and other stuff. Bo had met the love of his life, Dan Carmell, in l987, and I had met Chris Galloway, the woman to whom I am now married, in l992, so we were both grateful for our good fortunes in that. We were passionate young writers with bodies of worka couple books and lots of articles eachbeginning to get out in the world. I had a long future ahead of me and Bo, of course, had AIDS.  In the late l980s, AIDS was not the immediate death sentence it had been for the first years of the epidemic, but the main treatment then was AZT, which only partly treated it, and had horrible side effects. It was not a drug regime you could stay on forever.  In l991, Bo went to Zurich to undergo an experimental treatment for AIDS. His essay, Meditations in Zurich, published posthumously in Thomas Avenas anthology,   (Mercury House, 1994), is a nonfiction account of this experience. Its devastating in its personal and spiritual transparency. Sometimes I have found its intimacy hard to read. Its like Bo was holding nothing back, nothing. A mortal man seeing the body, the heart, the longing, the loss, the love, death.  As Avena recounts in his introduction to that volume, after treatment failed, Bo planned his death. He completed edits on his essay, gathered his family and Dan around him, and picked a day.  Bo Huston was born in 1959 in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, a name he got a lot of mileage out of. He left Chagrin and went to college, studied film, went to New York, became a junkie, left New York to get clean, got clean, moved to San Francisco, worked in advertising, fell in love with Dan, got AIDS, wrote articles and books, got sick then sicker, died. He did this all in not a lot of time. Wikipedia has informed me that another person born in Chagrin Falls was Sonny Geraci, the lead singer of The Outsiders, who had a hit in l966 called Time Wont Let Me. I remember this song from when I was ten. The chorus went like this:    (and so on... )  I like thinking of Bo thinking of this ridiculous song, this ridiculous connection, and kind of half smirking and shaking his head the way he did. Hes smoking a cigarette and has that look on his face. Time wasnt nice to Bo Huston, but he wrote profound and beautiful work, and he loved generously and well in the time he had.  I miss him.

Her other books (novels, short stories, essays, prose poems) include  ,  ,  ,  ,   (all with City Lights),   (HarperCollins) and   (Tarpaulin Sky).  She has also written a play, the libretto for a dance opera, a one-woman show,  , commissioned by Northwest Film Forum,  and popular arts and book criticism.  Her work has been translated into Japanese, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Italian, etc.  She lives in Seattle. Bo Huston was born in Chagrin Falls, OH, in 1959. After Hampshire College, he lived in Manhattan, where he got clean and sober and started writing. Bo moved to San Francisco in 1987 and, within a year, learned he was HIV+. Over the next too-short years, he lived and wrote and found a partner and a community of friends who loved him fiercely. He died May 24, 1993, surrounded by family and friends, at a time of his choosing. His last book,  , and an essay in Thomas Avenas collection   were published posthumously. His novel   was republished this year by the  , with a new afterword by Rebecca Brown, a contemporary of Bos he much admired.  The Bo Huston Prize  is an annual award to a writer completing a novel. Ronald Lockett  (1965-1998) was slight of build and sentient to the point of grace. Lockett existed somewhat precariously in a historical crossroads between two generations, after the great mid-century social movements had ended and just before the dominance of television and urban culture. He was a unique talent, influenced equally by Thornton Dial and Bob Ross, who he watched on television. He grew up in the wilds of post-industrial Bessemer, Alabama where he lived with his mother until her death, remaining in his childhood home until his own untimely demise resulting from AIDS-related illness. He never spent more than a few weeks away from home, but was able to mine far-flung histories, both personal and shared, with deference and aplomb. ",

        "text": "Art by Lyn Horton  I want to tell you my story about Laurel Canyon. When I was attending CalArts, one of the persons teaching me (now famous beyond words) rented a house on a street that began at one of the deepest points of Laurel Canyon Road. His students often met there to have discussions and to move forward with projects. One spring night towards the end of the school year, I was leaving his place; it was around midnight. Id stopped at the stop sign at the intersection of his street and Laurel Canyon Road. I pulled out to make a left turn, intending to return to the San Fernando Valley, when a pickup truck slammed my Mustang hatchback into the retaining wall. I wasnt wearing my seat belt. The impact threw me into the windshield and I fell into the well of the passenger side. The truck disappeared, leaving me abandoned on the side of the road.  The police had to piece this story together.  Lyn Horton,  , 2022. Black pigmented pen on painted wall, 142 x 225 inches. Site-specific installation, Future Lab[s] Gallery, North Adams, MA  Photo: Truanna Salmeron An ambulance swooped me away and dropped me at LA Receiving, where all unidentified injured people are taken. The police, or maybe it was the ambulance crew, had left my drivers license behind. For three days I lay unconscious as a Jane Doe in this facility. Fortunately, an attending doctor could tell by my skin and fingernails that I was not from the street. He rummaged around in my jeans and found a receipt in my pocket from a CalArts cash registera receipt with my name on it.  He was able to find out where my parents were (they lived in DC). Were it not for that doctor, theres no telling where I would be now. This is the story I was told. After my parents showed up, I was moved to St. Josephs Hospital in the Valley. I stayed there for ten days. I regained consciousness but sustained contusions of the brain and a concussion. Eventually, Mother and I went back to DC. It took a year for me to heal from the damage to my skull and brain. The muscles in my upper outer left thigh were deadened by the trucks impact. I had to learn to speak and walk again adequately.  Mother stayed by my side in the hospital, doing her needlepoint. She said to me: God knows you are here for a reason. I have taken that to mean that Im an artist, that there is something I need to say. There is a lot more to the story. But I will tell it somewhere else. In my last relationship, the arguments always became circular. He would interrupt and talk over me from late afternoon through dinnertime and into the night. He incited such anger in me. One time I was driven to completely destroy a shelf unit that I wanted to get rid of anyway. I threw the destroyed parts out a window near where this happened. Everything landed on the grass two stories down. Another time, frustrated and angry at the non-conversation, I went to my studio and destroyed a portrait of me that a past lover of mine had painted quite accurately. It was sixty inches high by twenty-eight or so wide. I took all the scraps and stuffed them into a file drawer near my drawing table. Later I threw the scraps away. The person I bought my condo / art studio from is the predominant property owner on this dead-end street. When I bought it, still-inhabited apartments waiting to become condos surrounded me. I was one of six participants in ownership. Now, there is one renter left, way over there. The guy next door is leaving after his last doctors appointment, postopen heart surgery. That is soon.  My neighbors on the other side of me are homeowners. They have different standards from mine, but since I befriended the female of the group, who works in the food service department at Williams College, her standards have changed. Ive brought up things that really need attention, like her two dogs. They dump and pee around the tree outside my studio window and near my parked car. We are slowly working that out. The smell of the pee and the disappearance of the dumps.  The fixer-upper that was just purchased at the other end of the street has a large picture window facing the street. A huge poop emoji is propped up in the window. I am going to take a picture of it and send it to C, the majority property owner and my friend. I have completely dug up the garden out front. This is the only house that has one. I want to be finished by July 4th. My neighbor with the dogs gave me four kalanchoes. I planted them in a beautiful pot I found at Walmart. Listening to music in the mornings brings me closer to the studio more quickly than spending time on the internet trying to connect with people. I am printing photos of sections of my drawings now. God, I hope Ill be creating this huge installation next year. All about branches, twigs, language, and communication. gray today. hearings today. art today. am trying to recover from digging out the yard on Sunday. Lyn Horton studio No matter how many snippets of books I read, I never see anything resembling the life I had. Everything I read describes some sort of normalcy. My life was not normal. I know what you are going to say. The garden out front is almost finished except for spreading mulch. After that task is complete, I will be able to go on hikes again and return to a routine of hiking on Sundays and taking pictures of what I see, things that I find visually interesting. My art ideas become more exciting the more I think about them. Im almost finished with the second scroll. I have to photograph the groups of twenty drawings I did before the scrolls. There are two more groups after the newest that I posted on Instagram. That group is so seductive. I sorted out my difficulty with X. He is so completely understanding. I was crying my eyes out yesterday morning. Beating myself up about misperceiving him. He put that to rest.  Periods of dizziness ruin my incentive to do things. Yesterday, I was supposed to go to a Laurie Anderson reopening of her VR Moon Project but I crapped out. I really love being alone but at the same time I hate it. Moving one foot in front of the other is the only way to avoid being overwhelmed. My days are filled with sparks of memories that fit into telling my story. Lyn Horton,  , 2022 I drank a lot of wine tonight. To accompany some sort of dread I feel. Guess it will work its way out by morning. The day was spent in large part in front of this damn computer screen, making sense out of files and Linktree, and just finding out about things. The more one does, you know. Writing about writing. I have been in less than a writing mood except for the latest story associated with photographs that I posted on my website under Photography. Because I am by myself I dont drive long distances these days. It concerns me that this will become normal, like taking the train to NY. (Will I ever get to NY again!?) I want to see the Eva Hesse retro at the Gugg. But the heat. Being on the second floor here means that it takes til 5 p.m. for the heat to rise and the sun to be correctly positioned to tell me to turn on the air conditioners for a little while. Its time to turn off the one in the living room. Back in Worthington, I was never hot during the summer. I took pictures from where I sat on the living room floor on Sunday evenings, looking out at the terrace with the sliding door open. The air would come through the screen and cross through to the windows behind me, opened to the porch in back. I hope the people who live there now have learned to appreciate what I did over those forty-two years. Its a new month. My son becomes forty-two in exactly one week.  Lyn Horton,  , 2021  adjusted, 8.5 in h x 11 in w I just deleted all my email from my inbox. Hope there was nothing important. Lyn Horton,  , 2022 Around one oclock, I was ready to leave my condo and go out. I put on my Merrell running shoes and my compression top, did minor pre-stretches, went out the door, talked to the neighbors who were washing their truck, and got into my car. Since theres been very little rain, I have not gone to the Cascades Trail; it leads to a really beautiful waterfall halfway up one of the foothills of the mountains. Today I went. It is the least taxing trek to take and be in Nature. I made the mile-long climb, leaving the trail occasionally to take pictures from the stream banks. I had on the wrong shoes, and so was wary of slippery rocks and mud; if Id put on my hiking boots, my steps would have been more certain. The falls were running despite the lack of rain and the drought around Western MA. Once Id seen them, I was happy. The sound of the water going downhill almost became enough for me.  People who visit the park get right up in the rocks surrounding the pool that the falls create. Their presence ruins any pictures that could be taken from a distance, which mine would have been and were. I hung around for some time listening to the water, photographing it flowing right below me.  I started back but my balance was off going downhill. I began to feel dizzy and ill and dehydrated. Eventually, the trail flattened and was less hazardous because there was no water and fewer rocks. But I had to watch for tree roots exposed from erosion and from having been trod upon thousands of times. I was exhausted when I reached my car. I drove to the co-op to buy some yogurt and garlic kraut and organic wine, some store-made chicken salad to put into my dinner salad. On my way home, I remembered that I had to edit Ps copy shed emailed to me before I left. This irritated me. The saving grace was that she told me shed found an intern. I thought about the energy Id put into the article Id worked on and how I had to regain it, somehow, in order to start all over again. This irritated me, too. These are the first new words:   And then I will go on. Its late. I finished Ps editing. Im trying to figure out what detachment means. Maybe it will become clear when Im not really thinking about it; maybe later. I am going to stretch now.  Ate too many cashews, washing them down with a fancy chocolate protein drink. Lyn Horton,  , 2021  60 in h x 88.75 in w, ink and marker on rag paper, titled and signed on verso Getting ready for my trip, the anxiety I feel leaving my North Adams condo is real. I go through the days imagining what I need to take with me, what will fill one large suitcase to be checked in at the counter. To get to the airport, I take the route I used to take from Worthington. I have to add an hour and fifteen minutes to the forty-minute ride. In the few days before I depart, I have to go to the dentist, go to Pittsfield to sell some of Mothers gold jewelry so I can give my son and his wife a partial wedding present of cash, take pictures of the public art billboards in Pittsfield, one of which bears my photograph, cook the perishables in my refrigerator and freeze them, pay a few more bills, and pick up all my prescriptions in Williamstown because the pharmacy in North Adams is closed. The pharmacist lost his wife and there is only one pharmacist who can substitute. Or NONE. The jewelry decision was hard to make. Mother wore the earrings and brooch for two historical and truly memorable occasions. (I remember them only through photographs.) One was the wedding of Margaret Truman, the Presidents daughter; the other took place in Norfolk, VA on September 7, 1996. Mother was invited to christen the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier. It was a big deal. President Clinton spoke, as well as a raft of other high falutin dignitaries. A video on YouTube documents the entire event, but I can never find the point at which Mother spoke. Ive seen it only once. She was speaking from the era in which she (and I) played a part. Drama was her thing; she missed being in the theater. I decided that cashing in the jewelry was something I could do now; I know how to do it, whereas my son would never know what direction to take. It makes me think that I should liquidate all my valuable art and whatever cannot fit in the safe deposit box to relieve him of these future divestments. I have begun many stories in my mind. Maybe one of them will take shape when I come home. Lyn Horton,  , 2022  60 in h x 85.875 in w, ink, marker and gouache on rag paper Hemingway never came back for his things at Sloppy Joes Bar.

        "text": " (Winter 2019) Like many girls from middle-class families, I grew up under enormous pressure to succeed. My father, a successful doctor, instilled ambition in me and modeled the rewards of hard work and dedication. But post-Islamic Revolution Iran was hardly the place for an ambitious career-oriented girl. I dreamt big, but the society and culture that surrounded me was far more concerned by the modesty of my clothes than with creating opportunities for learning and growth. The contrast between a Western family that instilled big dreams in a girl and a society that squashed all those dreams was an ongoing source of conflict. My life was therefore a paradox between what one could do as a young female in Iran and what I was driven to do with my ambitions and family background. I came to see our society as a farce. The majority of my personal network kept an outward Islamic appearance while struggling for freedom against its repressive forces. Not only were the dreams and careers of many repressed, mundane enjoyments such as music, dancing, and drinking were deemed illegal. In public, women had to cover their bodies and hair to prevent arousal in men, making everyday life painful and many other activities, like outdoor exercise or swimming, difficult or impossible. Restrictive clothing was the most obvious expression of control.  In the building complex where I grew up, there was a swimming pool. In the summer, men and women used it at different times. The pool was shrouded with a big tent, presumably to keep out the prying eyes of lusty youth, but it was impossible to cover it entirely from the direct gaze of those living in the tall apartment towers that surrounded it. Females as young as nine, which is the age that you become a woman in Islam, had to wear T-shirts and leggings under their swimsuits as a protective measure so those in the upper levels of the towers wouldnt be aroused by chance. The police and security forces that oversaw the propertys management strictly enforced these rules. As I entered adolescence I began to realize that these constraints on clothing have far more pervasive and pernicious consequences. They dont just restrict ones attire; they kill our dreams and aspirations. Even though I left Iran when I was relatively young, the indoctrination and the message that girls simply cant still echoes in my mind. The ridiculous clothing required for the swimming pool forever symbolizes for me the drowning of a girls dreams and quenching of the internal fire of her ambitions. It is not simply that you cant train to become a swimmer wearing such clothing; it is all about developing a sense of shame for being a girl. This feeling of inadequacy and shame gnaws at your unconscious long after the summer swim is over. In Islamic Iran, a womans greatest achievement is considered motherhood and serving her husband. My Westernized family understood these limits and encouraged me to seek an outside career in areas such as medicine or engineering. But I realized as a teenager that my love was art, and it took enormous work to convince my family and even myself that art can be a career. Given my struggle with my Westernized family, I wonder what it would have been like had I been brought up in a true Islamic household. I wonder how many dreams have died and continue to be crushed.

        "text": "MATERIAL WORLDS is an ongoing series at Evergreen where contemporary video artists and experimental animators discuss their relationship to tools, technology, and the history of art. The creator of the popular  video sketchbook , Erik Winkowski conducts mixed-media imagery like an orchestra. He uses vintage footage, paper cutouts, photography, drawings, and paintings for his wide output of animations and digital experiments that reference play, openhearted experimentation, the history of art, and daily living. Hes screened work in New York and Paris through CADAF, and hes made experimental digital art for Prada, Gucci, Herms, and the Rolling Stones. He lives and works in New Orleans.  Talk to me a little bit about your relationship with technology. Over the past couple of years, youve made a lot of AR [augmented-reality] work with filters. And pretty recently youve been using AI to make animations. Your most recent piece online on your Instagram is a full short film. Tell me about this process. Tell me how you landed here. We talked about this process a few months ago and I want to know where your heads at.  You know, with making video work, the primary way of sharing it has been through Instagram and places like Vimeo. We live, obviously, in a digital world, and I feel like embracing these as platforms has been a good thing for my art and something that has been good for me just exploring in my own work. Im just open to using as many tools as I can and open to experimenting. For me theres always a quality of the analog meeting the digital. For some reason I find that really interesting. And so I experimented with AR and more recently with AI. The AI stuffits so hard, theres so many crazy predictions about AI these days flying around. Its hard to come at it from a sensible place. But I think its probably going to have as big of an effect on art as the computer did. That said, there are people who are completely unaffected by the computer in their creative practice, more or less. I mean, besides contacting people. But for the most part, their art exists outside. Similar to the computer, I remember reading recently some of the first reviews of   or Pixar and people saying, What a shame, humans used to make movies and now computers are making movies. Thats so not the truth, obviously. Those are such heartfelt stories, coming deeply felt from humans, with so much love and craft going into them. So I think its possible to do that through a computer. I think its also possible to do that through AI. I dont know what that will look like. Were in a weird early stage where the generated imagery has been the primary exposure people have. Thats how people have come to understand AI. There will be probably be millions of ways that it will integrate itself, if you want, into your daily life and practice. But its such a big change that it is slightly freaky and I have mixed feelings about it. Ive already used it in some of my client projects for little things. Things you wouldnt even know that Id used it for. Like I couldnt find the right type of photo of a building. And so I did a, you know, image-generated thing and it was the perfect thing I was looking for. But like I was saying earlier, Im always interested in bringing something from the real world and comparing itmixing itwith the imagined world. I think a lot of AI, as it is right now, youre giving so much power over to the AI to kind of do both. Judgment aside, I just dont find it all that much fun as an artist. Which again, you need to go with what feels right. I feel like thats not a bad philosophy when making art. Do the thing that feels good. Thats what you should be doing. And at this current state, with AI, its not totally doing it for me. But theres incredible things coming out. Like Runway. I dont know if youre familiar  I think they do some of that. Topaz does that as well.   Runwaythey seem to be coming out every two weeks with some new piece of software. From removing backgrounds really easily from videos and all these other things. But they have their own video generation coming out right nowAI video generationwhere you can basically upload the video and then do a style transfer, so to speak. And so Ive seen people upload   intro and make it into a Cubist sculpture piece. Its totally glitchy in an amazing way. Its visually incredible, and at the same timeand I think you were saying this when we last spoketheres something that maybe feels a little hollow about it. And thats certainly a quality Ive felt. And I think something thats interesting about animation is that, up until 2023, if you looked at any piece of animation, you more or less got a sense of the insane amount of work that went into a piece. Especially as an animator. You get to knowhow did theythat was like a year of their life they spent on this thing. But now? I dont know. Ive done a couple of pieces that are on my Instagram that truly would have taken me a full year of painting to do. And I dont think I ever would have been able to pull it off. And to be able to do that in ten minutes makes you question the value of it. I think theres something about getting something too easy that makes it not be valuable anymore. But again, for me, the thing that Im excited about is the exploration process. The discovery. Going out into the world. Experimenting with tools and mediums. I actually believe that its possible to do that through AI. I did a fair amount of experimentation and there were all sorts of wonderful, happy accidents. But its probably going to be a tool within my tool set and not be the whole thing, if I do use it.  A post shared by Erik Winkowski (@erik.winkowski)  Yeah, I started talking about the limitations of tools. When I made that a couple of weeks or months agothis is like the speed that AI is going, where its like three weeks ago we were very limited by AI but now! But yeah, I was using Stable Diffusion and one of the ways you could animate with Stable Diffusion was to start with an initial image and tell it the things that are in the scene so it can kind of riff off that and give it a style. And so I was using minimalist abstract shapes and woodcut as a prompt. That prevented it from getting too crazy. You know, if you didnt give the minimalist, abstract blah blah blah, it can start getting to really tiny pixelated craziness and I wanted to keep the shapes pretty big. So there are these workarounds that you figure out. All sorts of times it came up with a solution that I never would have come up with. Its interesting, because in some ways it can be kind of limitingmaybe this is a good limitation to havebut youre almost limited by your own experience and your own imagination. This is one of the beauties of collaborating with someone else when you give them a prompt or something and you see their response and you are like, Wow, I never would have gone in that direction, but its kind of an interesting one. I feel like you get some of that in AI. Is it cheating? Maybe. Where you type in the thing that youre trying to do and it shows you a different way of doing it? Hmmm, maybe I should try that out! Thats a totally different approach than I would take. But then you wonder how much of this is yourselfwhich is another crazy part of AI. What are the data sets that its pulling from? It becomes this weird way of being able to create collages, pulling from the history of visual expression. It almost feels like a machine to manipulate the collective unconscious. Like Carl Jung. Its this weird dream machine. Its odd.

        "author": "Ava Homa",
        "text": "Art by Hushidar Mortezaie  Like any human child, I brimmed with the ecstasy of being alive, eager for exploring and celebrating life. Soon, too soon, came the hushed warning of the adults at the kindergarten: I had been born a convict, both female   Kurdish in a state that prided itself on its misogyny and chauvinism.  All I wanted was to run up the hills of mountainous Kurdistan that shone bright red with poppies in the spring. What a breathtakingly beautiful world it was that had wildflowers and singing birds, rivers, music, and laughter. But at age six, I was ordered to stop, to wear the black hijaba shackle to my childhoodand be inconspicuous because the female body was sinful, a source of temptation, the unnameable that led men to the inferno. If I werent seen or heard, it seemed, God and other men would be just fine. But why were butterflies so stunning and free to fly? How could I become one?  I learned to find joy indoors, in friendship, in books. In middle school, I was told a womans laughter should never go higher than a certain decibel, that good women wouldn't appear much in public. My very existencethere to strictly serve the familywas something to be molded into obedience, otherwise a males honor would turn into disgrace. Indeed, manhood,   or  , was measured based on a mans level of control over female bodies, bodies whose job was to offer pleasure, never to receive or demand it. I repeatedly got into trouble in school, for my loud voice, my loose headscarf, my love for lipsticks. What crimes! At the same age that my body was ordered to be hidden away, my mother tongue was also pushed to the margins. Educated to be fluent in Persian and illiterate in Kurdish, my dissociation with my heritage, my culture and history, started at elementary school. The linguistic oppression created cognitive dissonance between generations that have difficulty communicating. Only in graduate school did I learn that the deliberate targeting of a culture was ethnocide, a tried method of creating void shells out of humans. But thats not all. Most people in our region lived with entrenched poverty, dysfunctional or nonexistent infrastructure, limited and under-equipped medical, educational, and cultural facilities. What Kurds received in abundance was imprisonment and execution, oppression and discrimination. There were always people who had it far worse than I did, the friend who loved a woman and was dismissed from school for it, the ones with a serious disease or a disabled parent, the ones whose only solace was opium. Some of us were broken beyond repair, it appeared, and yet there were always unusual groups whod go out of their way to serve the community, activists, writers, journalists, artists who knew suffering and worked to minimize it. We only had ourselves to rely on. Our pain was intertwined, our liberty interdependent. Hushidar Mortezaie,  , 2022, Mixed media textile collage For as long as I can remember, I have carried a tightness in my throat, a heavy pressure on my chest. My suffocation was literal and figurative. At the most oppressive moments, Id instinctually burst into singing, realizing that it was medicinal. But female vocalists are by law forbidden from singing solo. Our voices, it was declared, just like our bodies, were tools for Satan to wreak havoc. My passion for dance and music died alongside my other desires for freedom, for celebrating the gift of life.  In my solitude, I found a meaningful, nuanced, and redemptive world in literature. They allowed me to travel across the globe. When I wrote, most of my writing was censored or deemed unpublishable for breaching Islamic laws. Theres an entire ministry dedicated to the censorship of books and media titled the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance,  . While a graduate student in Tehran, I worked at   as a journalist, and the paper was shut down. After graduation, I taught English at Azad University and was harassed for not following the laws properly. The state was, in one word, against life.  I found one safe and quick way out of Iran and that was through education. Using dial-up internet, I applied for and gained admission and a scholarship to study for my masters degree in English and Creative Writing in Canada. In my early twenties, my years of writing and activism in exile began. Ever since, I have lived in different cities on the East and West Coasts of the US and Canada, have written three books and hundreds of articles, and have delivered speeches across schools, colleges, and conferences in Europe and North America, including at the United Nations, Geneva. I take pride in being a voice, a bridge, in having honed my literary voice despite all the structural forces in place to muffle me. My debut novel   has been prescient in portraying the morality police, the enforced hijab, protests, imprisonments, hope, fears, and complexities of life in Iran.  I was able to rise above oppression because I stand on the shoulder of giants. Kurdish freedom fighters and Iranian feminists have separately resisted tyranny for over a century. The two aspects of my identity that had enmeshed me empowered me. But I also live at the crossroads of a conflict. You see, the problem is that while Kurds have made womens rights central to their resistance, Iranian feminists have largely failed to embrace intersectionality. And at this pivotal moment in Iranian history, intersectionality marks the difference between victory and defeat in the fight against religious dictatorship. Women in Iran have fought for gender equality since the 1910 Constitutional Revolution era. In the 1930s, fourteen magazines discussed womens rights, and by the 1970s women had gained some freedom of education and occupation. Sadly, the pendulum swung and in the early 1980s, after the Islamic Republic took power, women lost freedom   dignity. Nonetheless, they refused to give up fighting. As Iranian feminists became more outspoken and organized by the 2000s, the government enhanced the charges against them, indicting them with threats against national security.  The courageous women of todaybravely chanting woman, life, freedom and tossing their headscarves into bonfires despite the threats of persecutiondid not emerge out of a vacuum. Theyre the grandchildren of women who have fought for gender rights and paid heavy prices for it.  Women have been a pivotal aspect of the largest uprising that started in September 2022, but it would be a grave mistake to neglect other groups fighting alongside them. The young generationmen, women, and nonbinary individuals, the seculars and followers of different religions, middle class and working class, heterosexual and LGBTQ+have also been at the frontlines. But, so have the Kurdish and Baloch ethnic minorities, who have paid the heaviest price and  .  Over 60% of the children killed during the protests were Kurds and Baloch, according to Amnesty International. While real bullets were used in Kurdistan and Balochistan, blanks or rubber bullets were used in Tehran and other rich cities. Fighter jets, tanks, and convoys of armed vehicles loaded with troops were deployed in Kurdistan. The first massacre happened in Balochistan and ever since people have been consistently protesting every Friday. Yet their courage and resistance have been overlooked in Iran and abroad.  Ethnic minorities have been misrepresented in their own country and underrepresented in the West. The rulers, of course, are the main culprit for having created the division between the dominant Persian ethnicitywhich makes up about half of the Iranian populationand the remaining ethnic groups, Arab, Baloch, Turks, etc. But Persian intellectuals and activists, for the most part, have failed to rise above the propaganda and celebrate the historic diversity of Iran.  The negligence started to repair itself in the latest wave of protests. The young generation showed some willingness to include and support women and minorities. Its as if they intuitively understood that the path to freedom in Iran is through centralizing the historically marginalized. But the youth need intergenerational support to implement this liberating insight, this radical act of inclusion. The long-overdue ethnic unity has finally sprouted and nourished diverse groups, but it is fragile. For it to bloom, the voiceless must be heard in a safe space, away from biases and shortsightedness. We need acknowledgements, sincere apologies, and forgiveness to start on the long path of reckoning and reconciliation. At this stage, however, many Iranians are still terrified of the disenfranchised, still perceiving them as threats, still deeply attached to their limited views.  I can offer a glimpse into Kurdish realities herefor more see  and hope that other ethnicities will also be given the chance to be heard. Though they comprise ten to twelve percent of the Iranian population, Kurds are a   among political prisoners, the UN reported. Despite the gross discrimination, they are the ones who coined the slogan woman, life, freedom and have fought for it. They are the only group who have opposed the Islamic Republic since its inception in 1979, and have been consistent and well-organized in their opposition. Kurds werent offered the right to live and so they have had to fight for the right to exist and to live in peace. They live by their motto,  , resistance is life. \t However, Kurds are not only fantastical gladiators. Iranian music owes much of its prowess to Kurdish musicians and their ancient melodies. Kurdish filmmakers have won international awards. Kurdish group dance,  , and colorful womens dressesin stark contrast with the black veils imposed on the other women in the regionhave offered much vibrancy and beauty. Yet, Kurdish gifts have only been appropriated or neglected. Even now that Persians are finally showing some curiosity about Kurds and Baloch, they cannot overcome their sense of superiority. Minorities are never seen as equals. The assumption is that uptown Tehranians are entitled to their privileges and the ostracized minorities deserve to suffer. At the dawn of the largest uprising that has weakened the Islamic government, its a ripe time for those who demand justice to recognize and overcome their sense of supremacy. Freedom and equality is for everyone, not only a selected few.  Ever since the allies redrew the map of the Middle East after World War I, denying the Kurds a country of their own, the Kurdish populationestimated to number between thirty-five and forty-five million as of 2022has suffered innumerable brutalities at the hands of the states that ruled over them: Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria.  Southwest Asia and North Africa (SWANA), a current replacement for the loaded term Middle East, is home to many ethnic groups, the largest being Arabs, Persian, Turks, and Kurds. The only group left without a country in the age of nation-states were Kurds. Because of their desire to have what others had, namely the right to self-determination, they have been perceived as threats to be annihilated. A few examples are the 19371938 Dersim Massacre at the hands of the Turkish government, Saddam Husseins 19861988 Anfal Genocide in Iraq, the denial of citizenship to Kurds in Syria in the controversial 1962 census, the 1979 attack on Kurds in Iran, and the ongoing executions there.  Many decades ago, Kurds realized that independence was a means to an end, not a goal in of itself. There isnt much benefit in replacing a Persian dictator with a Kurdish one, after all. They demand justice and equality, and for the past few decades have tried to gain it within each separate country they live in. Iranian-Kurdish political leaders after the 1979 revolution sought autonomy, not independence, and yet for the past forty-four years accusations of separatism have continued. Some Kurds are so fed up with the social oppression rooted in ethnocentrismon top of state violencethat they do demand separation. Yet, their view is perceived not as a political choice or a protest to inequality, but as an act of treason! There has been no official referendum, but I suspect that like the Francophones in Canada, Kurds in Iran see value in being part of a larger entity,   that country accepts them as equals, entitled to the same privileges as the rest of the population. Even some feminists have been unreliable allies when it comes to ethnic oppression. By fearing and overlooking the Kurdish plight, by preferring nationalism over intersectional feminism, some have sadly turned into (unwitting) agents of patriarchy.  At this juncture in history, when brave Iranians have fought peacefully against a brutal government for months and months, authors and intellectuals need to become acutely aware of the necessity for the internal liberation of Iranian society. A truly democratic and free country would embrace diversity as its strength and would dismantle the foundations of dictatorship that are empowered through divisions. Our freedom is intertwined. No group can be liberated alone, at least not for gone.   Ava Homa is an award-winning novelist, a journalist, and activist. Her words have appeared in the  ,  ,  ,  ,   and more.

        "text": "Art by Kevin Tobin  Other images courtesy of the authors Kevin Tobin,  , 2022.  Oil on canvas, 12 x 16 inches  I just wanted to say congratulations on such a monumental accomplishment. Pulling together fifty years of workI mean, thats pretty amazing.  Theres one thing that makes it even more pleasurable: I get to have a book come out at the same time as yours, and you were my student, so to see you having risen to such a level of literary expertise warms my desiccated old heart.  Well, thank you, I learned from the best. In fact, working with you helped inform the mantra of my press, which is to publish writing focused on daring and provocative themesor transgressive, as they used to call itthat some of the mainstream publishers might shy away from. Your collection of stories fully embodies that. And I like to think that most of my own books I put out share the sensibility.     Yeah, Ive been called transgressive during the length of my careerand often ignored as a result. Until lately, it seemed to be getting worse rather than better. The more experienced I got, the more uninterested they all seemed to be. This anthology of all my short texts should prove to be the icing on the cake. Its every short text Ive ever written, going all the way back to 1970. As I was pulling it together, it became apparent how much politically incorrect stuff there is in therefrom the names people use for each other to the really different ways people looked at gender in the past. There was a temptation to update some of it to make it seem more in tune with current values. But I came to the decision that we all have a responsibility to keep the historical record accurateespecially for people who were not alive in those days. They need to see how we all talked and behaved in those times. So, I didnt change a word of any of my old stories.  I was a little nervous about some of the language, but it certainly does reflect the times in which the stories were written. And while it may be off-putting to some readers, I think its important that they learn about the progression of languagewhat was once deemed socially acceptable in the style we communicate with each other.  Why do I have to take the entire rap, Chris? Lets talk about your book and the many ways it violates normsin quite an original way, may I add. Youre writing about the industry of advertising, which has changed so radically since the   years that it seems, in some ways, a bit specious. They are very much pushing socially progressive values and attaching them to products because theyve determined that its the new way to sell things. Rather than interrupting people with ads that theyll scroll past or switch channels on, theyre trying to convince consumers that they have the same values and same beliefs that they have, that they are just as woke as they are. And your novel, well, it satirizes that shift in strategy while at the same time showing that the lifestyles of the employees who work to express these values for the purpose of selling products are anything but politically correct. Its this tension between their real lives and what theyre doing at work that makes your book fascinating. In fact, I havent seen any writing yet that illustrates the ways advertising has changed, except for your book. I think its going to be a startling read for some people.  I do feel that a lot of the work in advertising has become extremely paradoxical, and my book does center around the theme of leveraging social interests or orientations related to race and gender and sexuality to promote product. My book is called   because most of the characters in the book who work in advertising and PR dont understand the full importor the blatant contradictionsof what theyre doing or the repercussions it has on their personal lives. Just as you said, theyre living these completely opposite existences, and a good percentage may not even believe in some of the positions that theyre touting, or in the creative content theyre producing.  Okay, lets be bold and talk about some of these woke positions and the way they are being used in business. We might want to discuss them in relation to the positions of the past. In a previous conversation, you actually said to me that you thought that, in general, things are better now than they were in my generation. You must have known that you were pushing my buttons when you came out with that one.   I mean, I do think that in some respects things have improved in terms of how accepting weve become of various minority groups, and especially when it comes to gender and sexuality, all of which I was mentioning when you exploded. I was thinking of a lot of controversial topics that exist today, such as gay marriage or trans visibilityyoure not going to flip out on me again, are you?   No, Im feeling calmer now, especially if youll allow me to hold forth with a few examples. What about sex and sexual orientation?  We may have gay marriage, but in the old days, I could walk into a bar, whether it was a bar filled with my peers or a bar frequented by people of other classes and have a three-hour conversation with somebody before I went home with them. Not only was I able to examine that persons body, which I admit is the first thing I did, but I was also able to get a fairly good idea of who I was bringing home and whether they were dangerous or interesting. Now you fucking meet somebody online, they come to your door, and if theyre fatter than their picture, youre supposed to slam the door in their face! Well, I cant do that. Okay? It sucks.   I can relate to that. But if we look at your coming-out story, Myra, which you wrote way back in 1970, shortly after Stonewall, the characters who bring the boy out seem like they came straight out of the movie  . Its a violent coming outwith none of the self-acceptance we now associate with that process. Its downright scary. Or is it that people just dont talk about that today? Because, honestly, a lot of the ways that many gay men have come to terms with their sexualityeven todayare the result of such seedy encounters, sometimes with dangerous people. And today, I think we tend to try to glaze over such experiences and are more comfortable discussing love and romance and marriage.   Yes. My coming-out story from 1970 is nothing like the coming-out story you tend to see today. In mine, the guy finally realizes he must be gay because, first, hes impotent during his first heterosexual encounter, and very humiliated by it. So he flees that scene by hitchhiking and gets picked up by a couple of farmers in a truck, who pressure him into the most obscene, sexual, perverted first gay encounter imaginable. That story is very close to my coming out. It had little to do with, Oh, I learned to accept myself, that I too had the right to love. My coming-out story was, Shit, I guess thats what I like, and it sure did feel good, disgusted with myself as I am. So, fuck it. I know its wrong, but Im gonna keep doing it. Ha ha.  Bruce Benderson  I admit Ive had similar experiences. But tell me, what was it like going through fifty years of work when you pulled this book together? I myself resonate so personally with my work. Going back to it can almost be traumatizing. It brings up a lot of hurt or loss from the past. How hard was it for you to look back all the way to your very early twenties?   The thing that startled me the most was the discovery that, style-wise, at twenty-two I was writing almost exactly the same way I write now. My narrative craft seemed just as economical and just as articulate as the type I favor today. So I started thinking, where did I learn all that? And I remembered seeing a document that my older brother, whos a lawyer, was working on and thinking the style resembled mine, which made me remember that our parents made both of us take Latin in high school. It hit me that Cicero was responsible for my style. Cicero, with his long sentences and dependent clausesmy having to translate his writing from Latin. Oh, my God, I thought, Ive been copying Cicero all my life without being aware of it.  The other thing that happened was the release of a lot of buried memories. In my archives I found a lengthy typed manuscript Id forgotten about that was inspired by a lover who later committed suicide. And other disturbing feelings resurfaced too. I found myself thinking stuff like, did I really do that with that junkie? The one who was shooting up in my bedroom with blood gushing out of the needle all over my pillow, while I was telling myself I was deeply in love with him? As a matter of fact, the biggest realization was about how much time Id wasted on sexual pursuits. Im no longer a big supporter of perpetual promiscuitynot for moral reasons, but because its a time-waster.  Funny you should mention that change of opinion. As a recent transplant to Los Angeles, Ive found myself getting more involved in spirituality as it was discussed in the past. Ive been reading books by Alan Watts and Ram Dass. And one of the things both are saying is that becoming a little more enlightened and aware of the present will help you to transcend your lust in relationships and orient you toward more meaningful development. In other words, its more evolved not to focus so much on wants and desire because those things are in danger of consuming you and cutting you off from true happiness.   I couldnt agree more. Too bad I didnt learn that until my seventies, because now nobodys interested anyway. Your book, on the other hand, has a very compelling portrait of a contemporary gay guy with a very important job in advertising whos also compulsively promiscuous and uses a lot of drugs, and he fucks up an account worth millions because of his interest in sex and cocaine. Its hilarious and totally disturbing at the same time.  Its just that hes in need of constant stimulation and always compelled to move on to the next thing. Hes impulsive.  Isnt that the basis of promiscuity?   Yes. But giving into impulse and living a mostly hidden and hedonistic lifestyle is in part a product of working in advertising, because a lot of their work is so disingenuous. That characters behavior reflects on a lot of people who work on the agency side of things.  Thats the best thing about your book, in my opinion. Its filled with people acting superficial but managing to evolve in certain ways. Somehow you managed to tie all that to character development, which I found fascinating.  Yes, but whereas my narrative does focus on such things, it also takes a serious look at key social movements that were climaxing around the time the book takes place. The Black Lives Matter movement is one obvious example. I think I tried to show how important such movements are, even though some of the white characters in the book who participateor rather, claim toare doing it because it looks good on social media. Theres a self-serving element. Theyre looking for likes as much as theyre looking to do good.  Oh my, youre pressing my hoary old buttons again. What you said made me think of Catherine Deneuve signing a letter written in France by a group of women stating that they think flirting is an important aspect of male-female relations. So what happens to poor Deneuve, who was one of many signers? Another actress, whom I wont dignify by naming, publicly conjectured that Deneuve signed the letter because she must be senile. Lovely: using ageism in defense of the #MeToo movement.  What I hate most about all of that is that no one ever mentions that many women are still being raised to think they cant make it on their own and need to be protected. They need the police, or the courts. As the columnist Rosie DiManno wrote in the  , women shouldnt be thought of as snowflakes or the weaker sex who need our husbands and our brothers and the   to rescue us. Most men have been educated so much in the opposite directioneducated to have agencyand if this had happened to me, I would have said, Okay, yeah, suck my dick and get it over with, if thats so important. Then lets discuss the movie youre putting me in. Or I would have made my displeasure known in a very assertive way, not even barring violence, and my guess is that many other men would react the same way. If women are not being raised to protect themselves and to stand up for themselves, they wont do well in such situations.  Christopher Stoddard  Okay, but on the flip side, Ive personally experienced through my jobs in the corporate world women whove been sexually harassed or violated in some other way, even though I do think that some people are approaching it in a very extreme and illogical way. Despite that, too many cases do bring to light the oppression that women have experienced in various industries, and I think its important to call that out, but I also think we need to be careful.  Fine. Quite probably, whats currently happening in the Black Lives Matter movement and the #MeToo movement are merely passing stages during which we have to accept what I hope is a temporary but incredible divisiveness in American society. For as long as Ive lived, Ive never seen so much of this. And its all around these issues. So far, were not accomplishing what the people who brought up these issues hoped for. Were merely dividing our country in a very brutal way, and some people are using these issues very opportunistically.   You yourself have written in the past about the various clashes between classes and other groups within our metropolises. So, I wouldnt say whats happening now is anything new. Maybe its just being taken to a different level at the current time?  Yeah, its not like things were ever fair. As I mention in the preface to my book, my stories were written at a time when the powerful were the ones defining and naming people who were less powerful. It was wrong. But now the way that its being dealt with isnt a complete solution. Your novel deals with that subject. Im talking about the scene in which a woman is attacked sexually in such a vicious manner that all she can do to defend herself is commit murder. Shes up against a very brutal rapist who is also a very famous guy, and he Oops, spoiler alert! Ill just say that, in my opinion,   is feminism: standing up for yourself and correcting something bad no matter what it takes. Not appealing to substitute daddy figures like lawyers or cops.  Another interesting similarity about both our books is that a lot of the characters tend to come from non-bourgeois backgrounds.  Which of your characters are you talking about?  One of the main characters, Ella. She comes from a lower-middle-class background, and now that shes risen in the world of advertising, shes leading a kind of fake life. Shes got the fancy clothes, shes making plenty of money, and shes working at this highbrow boutique advertising agency. Yet, in many ways shes still that person from the past. This comes through as she deals with a lot of stressful situations, ultimately using her background to empower herself and fight back.  Thats another aspect of your novel I love. You showed how little these people who have managed to advance so far economically have looked inward. Theyre not in touch with their impulses and what these impulses mean. Until theyre forced to confront themselves. I guess they fucking need psychotherapy.  Not exactly, Bruce. In some ways, several of my characters   self-aware, but its working to their detriment, because theyre also judging themselves at the same time, which is the source of their stress and anxiety and, ultimately, their drug use and promiscuitytheir way of dealing with such trauma.  True. Christopher Stoddard  I know you know that my novel is ultimately a satire, and although its a very bleak one, there are definitely some humorous elements to it. Your book also has a text that takes place in an advertising agency, and its a satire as well. Its called Persistent Patsy, and its rife with dark humor.  Mm hmm, the characters name is Patsy and shes persistently a patsyha, haso the title is a pun. Its about a middle-aged woman who has been a proofreader at the same advertising firm for years. All that time shes been trying to rise to the level of copywriter and has been kept back. Worse, she was once also a very hot Club Kid who wore wigs and cellophane dresses to clubs and got a lot of attention for it. But now shes too old for that. Shes just an aging proofreader all the younger employees ignore. When a very attractive man whos a new employee arrives, she mistakenly begins to think that he will change all of that, and it ends in absolute disaster.  Advertising in general can be very ageist. They say that in advertising, you age out after fifty and begin to be considered irrelevant in that world. Its definitely one of the big fears of all the ad people I know. Myself includedwhich is partly why I was ready to move into another kind of job and ultimately did.  Well, my story isnt based on anyone in particular, unless its an inner me. Its just a satire.  Speaking of satires, my favorite story of yours remains the satire about Nancy Reagan. The one called Pretending to Say No. Well, thats the story Dale Peck chose for his anthology,   But I wonder if Nancy Reagan ending up in a crack house while in search of magenta thread to fix her hem would get as many laughs today.   I saw you perform that story at Theatre 80 St. Marks in the East Village as part of the   Festival. It was amazing.  Its very political. Nancy Reagan tries to show equality and understanding to these dirt-poor people whose only living is drug dealing, and the things that she says reveal her cluelessness and entitlement without her even being aware of it. It was written at the time when the Reagans were trying to deal with AIDS and the drug epidemic. I wanted to show how absolutely uncaring and self-involved they were. So it is a comedy of manners. Thats what those things used to be called.   Your book also contains two very long parodies of old-fashioned noirdetective novelsclearly inspired by the language that Dashiell Hammett or one of those writers would have used but at the same time mercilessly satirizing it. My favorite is Recommendations for the Mass Production of Teenagers, which was written using a lot of 50s noir lingo, and as a result the copyeditor had such a hard time with it. For me, that story is reminiscent of your novel  , because both use outrageous footnotes to undercut whats happening in the text above them.  That title, Recommendations for the Mass Production of Teenagers, was intended to parody those Soviet handbooks for increasing production on farms or in factories. I was hinting that children are raised in just such a cookie-cutter way. If you were middle class, growing up in the 50s was a bit like being mass-produced, because we were all being taught to believe in the same things and to dress and behave in the same way. I really get my jollies in that story bashing the nuclear family, something Im always ready to do. One of the footnotes goes on for quite a long time, accusing breeders of being people who have no sense of direction and have decided to use children as implantation devices for their unresolved insecurities and lack of self-awareness.  I remember you telling me that the only creative thing the average person can do is make a baby, which embodies the extent to which weve lost our imagination and are looking for a readymade set of values to live byfamily values. You touch on the same thing in your book  , where you portray marriage as yet another way of assimilating us into the mainstream.  Yes, absolutely. Im against marriage. Im not against gay marriage per se. Im against all marriage, because I do not believe that a sacred ritual should have any legal significance. Separate Church and State, for fucking sake! Have your weddings and any religious ceremonies you want. But I was hoping that, instead of fighting for marriage, LGBTQIA people would fight for universal domestic partnership, so that their inheritance and their health-care decisions would be secured. Instead, they put all their reliance on an institution that has proven to be one of the most unstable social establishments there is: fucking marriage. Give me a fucking break!  Well, as someone who will be married in the near future, I think you can interpret marriage as you wish, but I do value its various legal protections for couples, especially as you get older. And I also think theres something special about announcing your love and devotion for someone in front of your friends and family. What follows doesnt necessarily have to be the kind of life the world is prescribing for you.  Whos that incredibly handsome hulk who just walked by behind you? Thats your future husband, right? What a looker, you lucky bastard!  I rest my case, Bruce!

        "text": "Art by HK Zamani HK Zamani,   (in a grid), 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches (frames: 12x16 inches) A crown prince, a cult leader, and a cleric walk into a bar, were the first words I heard. Who picks up the tab? Not the cleric, someone muttered. Gotta be the prince, someone else said. There was a pause as the editor wrote crown prince, cult leader, and cleric on the whiteboard in her hot pink marker. She put plus signs between them and an equal sign after. Then, with a dramatic flourish of the marker that reminded me of a curvature my old gym teacher had made to describe what my scoliosis looked like, she made up the largest question mark she could. I dont know the answer, she said with a big smile. But were here to solve that. And more. Welcome to the first meeting of the initial symposium for the Iran Issue, ladies. There was some lukewarm clapping, a stray chuckle, a few sighs, a smokers cough. We broke for tea and out of the twenty-four women originally in the conference room, twenty-two returned. I thought to myself, the people who would have noticed the most were the ones who were gone probablyexcept maybe for me. We are off to a great start, the editor announced loudly as people returned to their seats around the giant conference table. On the board she had written WOMEN LOVE FREEDOM and if that wasnt bad enough, she was saying it. WOMEN LOVE FREEDOM!! Women   Freedom, an older voice corrected. Live freedom? That can work, the editor said, pausing.  I wondered for a second if this was some kind of skit. Women, life, freedom, another louder older woman shouted. Its three separate things. Like a list. We can make it anything we want to today! a younger attendee quipped, embarrassed for the editor at the whiteboard no doubt. Live, laugh, love, the editor said. Women, life, freedom. It clicks doesnt it? Even better than I thought! It really felt like a skit. Its from a Kurdish activist slogan, surely you know this! a woman who just had to be an academic shouted. She knows! Several women immediately hushed her. Love still works! someone yelled, with a few claps as if to . . . something. Whats going on? one of the journalists in front of me asked another presumable-journalist. The editor went as rosy as her rosy pantsuit.  She closed her eyes for a moment and then, as if like in the cartoons a light bulb had been lit above her, she changed routes. Listen, I am new to this, the editor said, clearing her throat in a way that signified importance or so she had learned from television. And my slot is only fifty minutes. I am here to tell you I dont speak Persian. I was born here. I have never been to Iran, I dont know anyone there. I rarely eat food from Iran, I couldnt tell you what our country looks like. She paused with closed eyes. Dramashe knew it was a bit much but she also knew it was the way of her people. I hated watching this. But. And theres the  . It is my country. I would do anything for it. I would die forwell, maybe not die! But you knowit is mine, it is all of ours! There were some light wisps of laughter throughout the room and then some scattered applause, isolated thunderclaps meant to save face. A few knowing glances, a cough, someones notifications.  I wanted to disappear. Anyway, I for one love WOMEN LOVE FREEDOM or maybe even better WOMEN LIVE FREEDOM because we do, do we not? she said. She was once told to lean into her errors in a womens studies class in college, I imagined. Yes! Yes! two younger intern-seeming women called out. I checked out mentally. I knew I was not alone. , the writer next to me texted her friend in the far back corner of the room, turning her head just enough so her friend could make out the crease of her dimple just so activated.  I knew who it was because I had seen them come in together and I knew the friendan illustratorsomewhat from social media. , the illustrator friend texted back, quickly.  she considered tagging on a rolled-eye emoji. , the illustrator wrote her in a way that made me want to grab the phone and type back   but the truth was everything felt that way that season. , she wrote back, which I had once been told was the coldest way to write that word. No period, nothing, no effort. It was enough. We watched her friends notifications get silenced.  She sent her a black heart emoji, for whenever shed get it. HK Zamani,  , 2022, Mixed media on panel, 45 x 24 inches The whiteboard had filled up considerably after lunch and the architect was fixating on the quadrant at the center of it all: MODELS / INFLUENCERS / ENTREPRENEURS /ACTRESSES. Another hand had crossed out ACTRESSES and turned it into ACTORS with a small happy face and heart next to it.  They were making a list of women in these categories. The typical Persian woman is average height, curvy but still slim, light olive skin, silky thick black hair a woman in a yellow frilly dress, whose job none of us could figure out, was saying. There are Persian blondes, excuse me, an older singer we all recognized spoke up. She was a Persian blonde and to be honest her famousness shocked all of us. I mean of course she was here but how could she actually be here?! Myself of course, but many others. Lets not ignore. We want Americans and Europeans to know we can be them easily. There were several vigorous nods and a lot of silence. She was not known for her brains but still, because she was so famous, we all noted it honorably. The yellow frill went on. She is college-educated, more than half holding graduate degrees, making high five figures to seven figures, married with two children within ten years An older woman with short white hair, in a large purple pashmina, suddenly got up and walked out the door. She had her things. She had the look of someone in the arts, possibly from another country. The editor noted her more than the restshed somehow hoped to speak to her by the end of that day. There was something about her. Are we losing people? the editor suddenly heard herself say. She wasnt supposed to say that. I am sorry. This is all just a lot of pressure. I am not done though, the yellow frill said in a suddenly weak way as if the purple pashmina white hair had sucked a substantial amount of power out of the room. There was a hush that sounded like a breeze working its way through the room. Does anyone else want to do this? she asked. I dont know what I am doing. No one wanted to so we all took a break and after the break, the editors assistant took over. Shes fine, she just is practicing self-care, she said quietly and began a Powerpoint presentation on the Great Women in Persian History, which everyone decided was a success because, throughout it, no one had given in to the urge to walk out. HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches  At lunch time there were several options: salad which was just one big vat of romaine with tomatoes saturated with a balsamic vinaigrette, it looked like. That went the fastest. There was a separate station labeled khoresht/stew which seemed to mainly be a sort of South Asian dal several women loudly pointed out though no one quite minded because who was going to be upset about decent dal? This area was known for South Asian communities, they were told. There was another station labeled keto/paleo that seemed full of meatballs and which was largely unattended until, of course, the tallest and thinnest woman in the whole symposium went over. She was wearing brown leather plants. Once she did, a few of the younger women followed her lead.  Are you paleo? she heard someone ask.  Silence. Keto? Silence. Just wanted to try it, another voice whispered. Me too. Pre-diabetes is so common among our types, an older voice intervened. Im a fitness expert and I cant even begin to tell you what I see these days. Are you two familiar with reactive hypoglycemia? No but my mom was just diagnosed with Diabetes 1.5, one said. I heard of it but I just, like, have PCOS, the other voice said. My acupuncturist thinks its mostly gone though right now. The editors assistant announced that lunch was going to be an hour longer than what was on the program because the meditation experts dog had to go to the animal hospital. Hopefully nothing is too bad with her baby and she will join us tomorrow, the assistant said to no one in particular. Please enjoy the gift of this extra time!  I decided to raise an enthusiastic fist, the kind of symbol youd use at a pep rally, a cheer. It was a bit much, sure, but I couldnt help it. It was so nice to think of a dog. HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches  I had received the invitation from an email I didnt recognize. My first instinct was that it was someone harassing me or trolling at least. It sounded too patriotic, too nationalistic, the invite in gold and green and red, the particular cream white of the background even signified a kind of inspired formality that bordered on parody.  I was definitely honored that it recognized my contributions to Iranian societies all over the world, all these years, but I had questions. Of course I understood the BCCif you work in these sensitive areas in Iranian circles, your privacy and in fact anonymity is key. But it did make accepting it an issue. If  was involved for example, I would have no choice but to declinethe rumors about her allegiances, especially as of recently, were too much. Speaking of that, if  was involved Id also have to declinenot because of her (I rather like her, truth be told) but because of her husbands recent social media posts which no one in their right mind could engage with. We were all hoping it was some kind of mental health blip, if one has to be totally frank. I also just would steer clear of  and not because they are not doing great work but because Id caught both of them more than once being passive-aggressive about me, to put it most charitably, and I dont think they knew I noticed or perhaps they hoped I forgot. I never forget things, not things like that. I hope of course  is not on that list, though she probably is, but to endure her would require way more of me than these people could afford. And  and  and ? This girl squad has been relentless about their self-promotion this season, but no one I know takes them seriously so it would be a hard pass. Many years ago, a young journalist from a French magazine once asked me who I could see leading usand I had assumed in politics, but the writer who was very young, said arts was fine tooand I said I had no real answer for things like this. She had turned off the tape recorder and said this was what she thought and feared, that in my communities no one could put their name behind or even by each other. How did we hope for any progress when we had no one? I really had nothing to say to her past thatshe wasnt entirely wrong. (I never saw the interview run anywherewhat would it have said? Blank by blank?) So I dont know what got me going, truth be told. I got messages all the time from young women in Iran asking me to post things, to like and comment, to gather my most influential friends, to write a famous person on their behalf, etc. and maybe it was that very urging for my involvement on their behalf that made this delegation more appealing to me. I really dont know how to explain itI was acting in all sorts of ways that winterbut before I knew it I had responded to the email and I had signed on. My agent haggled a bit and got the fee closer to our standard which was strangely much easier than it usually was when there would be sometimes a dozen back-and-forths all to just promise something that was half our target. I decided to look on this as charityan act of goodwill based on absolutely nothing. If  and  and  and  and  and all those others were indeed there and I had to endure all that, on top of god knows what, well, then it would still be nothing close to what my sisters and brothers in Iran were enduring. And wasnt that the best kind of charity anyway? Sacrifice. If I had to imagine any kind of Iran Issue in my head, aside from all the more satisfying creative aspects and the inevitably honorable activist aspects, I would have to say the flavor of the experience would be undoubtedly cold hard bitter dry sacrifice. HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches A bunch of these influencers are just grad students, she was saying. Making their way through tuition. I miss when grad students did sex work, she said. They still do that, no? Well, maybe the Arab girls, these are the Purrrrsians. They would never, she said.  -get it? Do they really need the help, the money for grad school? I looked up the three or four I had never heard of and all of them are linked to fathers with major business abroad, she said. Do we do this kind of speculation with white girl influencers? Well, yes, we do. What if we crossed them out entirely? Could the thing float? What are they offering? Arent the models covering the good looks department? The average Irooni girl is better looking than most influencers, which in terms means many times better looking than the average girl anywhere. Why are we stuck on this? Where were we? Content? Love, this is content. Laughter. She continued, These girls run content. If you were looking for literally anything else, Id say, lets change the subject, but this is it. Content. Im fine with that. Are you? And you? You? Looks like were fine. Lets start a new page, thanks. HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches The first day had gone better than most of them had anticipated, the editor probably thought, I told my husband. He was three thousand miles away and had booked my flight on points. We had asked them to cover airfare but they said since my rate was negotiated at a higher rate than most, I would have to arrange my own travel, they were sorry to say. My husband thought it was fine as he had hoped this would be good for me which I had laughed at as it had sounded like organic vegetables or somethingwhen he clarified that what he meant was the bonding with all the women. I had told him during that call that there would be no chance of that, which he was confused about, until I mentioned I meant the other women. Of course he wondered what was wrong with them but I just told him nothing and didnt explain until he nudged me and then I said something that he claimed was like the clich of  . I laughed and admitted that that was a lie and it was them and then he laughed too in a way that made me certain he thought I was a fool. A fool too. Maybe I fit in. I wanted to tell him about the older woman in the purple pashmina and the two others who left earlier, how I admired their realness, how I wished I knew where they went. Maybe they were off to visit the famous museum in town. Maybe they were at a bar trying to forget everything. Maybe they went shopping, even though I was told this city had pretty awful shopping. Maybe they were going to come back tomorrow. Instead of that idea, other ideas came to me. For example, when I was a child I had joined Girl Scouts for a year. My father had forbidden it, just like he forbade sleepovers, just like he forbade parties and dances and womens magazines. I didnt know what my father hoped I would turn into but I knew Girl Scouts couldnt hurt.  There was one other Iranian girl who had just enrolled in our school and she was there. As it went, she was the first set of eyes who made eye contact with me. Her eyes, large and brown like mine, looked frightened. We had gone around and introduced ourselves that first day and the leader of the troupe had asked for us to tell one fun/weird fact and one reason why we were here. The other Iranian girl, whose name was Americanized in a silly way like minewho probably like me resented that there was someone to recognize that silly Americanizationsaid as her fun/weird fact that her father was in prison and would probably be in there forever (we visit him though, she said soberly). For her reason she said she was hoping to learn how to use a knife. Were not going to be getting to knives anytime soon, the leader chuckled softly. But I am sorry about your dad. Where is his prison? She said it in a way that almost made me laugh as it made it sound like  , like the man owned it. I had a feeling I knew where it was. I was right. HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches When they got to me I wanted to make sure I was nothing like her in my answers. I told them that my fun/weird fact was that I didnt have one, that I was very normal and almost boring. It was the first time I used that line. The leader looked amused by me, though amused in a way that told me someone else must have said it before, and then she asked me what I hoped to learn. I said knitting, even though it was a lie. We never learned knitting and to this day I have no idea how to knit. Eventually my father found out and I was forbidden again but not in a way that made me want to join again. I had found it boring to be honest.  They lost two Iranian girls that year. The other Iranian girl moved. No one said it was to Iran. Still I imagined it was there and I tried to imagine her there doing all the normal things, but for some reason my mind kept going back to her father and the knife and the way those two things could be connected. I was thinking about this all at the hotel bar, thinking if I should leave my husband a voice memo to tell him about this, while I drank my mediocre Chardonnay. I didnt have the energy. Instead I tried to get myself to admire the maroon carpet with its beige diamond pattern, the Greek columns, the cheap candles, the fake orange leaves that were dangled off the room beams, the smell of generic womens perfume and toxic cleaning agents, the sound of hotel lobby Muzak and the distinct whir of a vacuum cleaner. I told myself I was lucky to be there and with every sip, I felt luckier. I ordered myself a second glass of Chardonnay and then finally a third with a bowl of hot nuts. That third glass always stung because of how four could just be a bottle but then again who was going to order a bottle? , I spoke dramatically in a voice not quite mine into my phone, and hit the arrow for the voice memo to do its thing. I wanted to hear him laugh or else hear him be momentarily fooled or confused or something but instead I heard a less-familiar-but-still-familiar Excuse me? The bar was more crowded suddenly and the editor, still in her bright pantsuit, was bending over me as if she was a giant and I was the smallest woman on earth. I looked under the table, expecting to see her high heels but instead she had on leather flats with cloying bows on them. Her height could not be understood, not by me in that moment, certainly. Did you leave your scarf in the conference room? She was holding a black wool scarf out to me that for a second I thought about claiming. It was the most generic scarf Id ever seen and pilling though otherwise decently expensive, it seemed, but her effort just somehow shocked me. No, not mine, I said trying to smile. I hoped she had not been watching me drink all those drinks. Thanks. She nodded with a much bigger smile than I deserved and as she walked away she tripped a bit. In those flats. I must have been the only person who saw it, but I definitely saw it. By the time I made it back to my hotel room, my husband was texting me over and over,  . My husband, who was white, had never called me bitch before. I realized I was supposed to joke back to him, that that was how these things went, but instead I was thinking of that scarf and those flats and the Iranian girl with the dad in jail wanting to learn knife skills and how tonight, of all nights, my husband of seventeen years had gone as far as to call me  . HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches  The Iran Issue never happened. Or if it did I never heard about it. Something about Iran is that Iranians are often the wrong audience for the Iran stuff. So it could have. But who would know. I thought I saw the editor one day at an Orange County Persian restaurant that was located in one of those upscale malls. She looked very well-put-together as usual, navy knit cardigan, floral skirt, gold accents, blown-out hair. I tried to ignore her presence and just focus on my husband and his college friend, but I also worried that maybe she had seen me and ignoring was only making things worse. I vote say hi, my husband said winking at his friend. I should have no vote but I vote the same! his friend said. I started to feel like my hesitation was sillyafter all, she likely did not even remember me and would probably just be very nice about it. She might be relieved someone remembered her efforts, even if the thing never existed. So once we got to the tea course and my husband and his friend were gently fighting over the billas opposed to the Iranian style which would not be so gentleI decided to go up and approach her table. They were in sync with us and she seemed at peace stirring sugar cubes into her tea over and over. There were another handful of people at her table and it was hard to figure out ages or relationstypical Persian stuffbut I realized her placement in the very large circular table made it perfect for me to kneel or at least hunch and just with decorous discretion ask the obvious. I hope you will excuse me, but are you the editor of the Iran Issue from a few years ago? She was smiling at me blankly, her eyes focused somewhere entirely beyond me. I said it again as it seemed she maybe did not hear, but I did take note that there were two empty bottles of wine at the table. In a thick accent I could tell was fake, she said, I am sorry I am not sure what you mean? Do I know you? For a second, I really believed I had it wrong and she was someone else but then I remembered her better and I could imagine shame driving her to that kind of response. The accent was such a move thoughfew would go that far. Its okay, its really okay. I thought it was a good experience and you did a nice job. I understand if nothing can be said. Her accent only grew thicker, it felt like. It didnt quite sound Persianmaybe Georgian? I wasnt sure. My dear, how can I knowwould you like some tea? Cookie? Baklava? she began pushing plates at me. I tried to keep my cool. We all have our different things that shame us but you really have no need to do this, I said firmly. For a second there was a disturbance in her eyes that told me she knew. But then it was gone again, broad fluttering smile blocking her humanity. It never happened? I went on. She shook her head and began to get up. For a second I wondered what she was up to, when I realized she was just brushing me off and going to the bathroom. What was I going to do then? Follow her in there? I did not do that. HK Zamani,  , 2022, India ink on found paper, 14 x 10 inches  A few weeks later I was trying to tell a friend about the whole disaster of the Iran Issue and I went to find her profile on Facebook and it would not let me click. I could tell she was on there but . . . apparently I was blocked. I went on Twitter and Instagram and same thing. My friend could see her profiles but said I wasnt missing much. Selfies and Yahoo News type clips, she said. For reasons I could not quite understand, this made me furious. When we got off the phone I wrote her a long email detailing how unprofessional and bizarre she was and how the issue had not happened thanks to her and how she had said WOMEN LOVE FREEDOM and how she had denied knowing me at the OC restaurant and how her accent was so fake and how everyone was probably so glad there was no Iran Issue if it was going to be helmed by an unhinged disaster like herself. But by the time I reread it, all I could do was hit delete. , I imagined my husband saying though I would never have shared this with him. , I imagined the old lady in the pashmina saying. , I imagined a teenage girl, the defiant schoolgirl in Tehran saying, flipping through its too-many pages of self-congratulation and promotion and influencers and airbrushed shoots.  . In an Iran this close to its liberation they would never need us, I wanted to tell the teenage girl, but I couldnt tell if she was mockingly listening to me or really cared what I had to say. I kept telling her something I had heard before which she smiled at but I couldnt tell if it was because it was corny wherever it was from. I didnt have an original worldshe had to know that. Her smile was so big and soon I realized it was directed to a crowd behind me, a crowd coming at me, a crowd coming through meI was of such little consequence, they could move right through my body like ghosts except they had to be the real ones in all this and me the ghost. Indeed I could feel myself fading, but instead I saw dozens, then hundreds, then maybe thousands of them, radiating something like heat as they marched toward an even greater source of heat. It was something like the sun burning bright but we were too close to really tell what it was. At a certain point I could no longer see themI could no longer see anythingbut it wasnt just me fading, it was them becoming something bigger altogether. Fire can burn, but fire can also warm. I thought I heard crying but then I realized it was probably laughterhow similar the two could sound if enough people were deep in them. I had a hard time imagining the world of malls and whiteboards and emails and influencers in all this sudden something, but I was consoled to believe in this bigger thingto know that this was it, that this was all them, that the only thing that wasnt quite real in any of this was us and the past.

        "author": "Ikechukwu Ogbu",
        "text": "Art by Giancarlo LaGuerta Problem started when Eberes husband died by accident one morning on his way to the big city to race through some last-minute shopping for their daughters birthday party. When Ebere received the news, she was out on the veranda, sifting chaff from a tray of brown beans. She was about to prepare some beans for her daughter. Three year old Oluebube liked beans so much that shed cry if her mother did not serve them with the white rice and some chicken stew she planned to serve at the party. Out on the lawn, a group of chattering, rural women milled about a huge pot of rice cooking on three huge stones. Between the stones, three logs of firewood burned slowly, sending plumes of smoke into the morning air, the smell of festivity finally taking hold of the neighborhood. To the right of the red fenced-in bungalow in which Ebere and her husband lived, a dreadlocked DJ stood in front on a turntable stand, playing Evi-Edna Ogholis Happy Birthday, his ears covered with a white headphone, and nodding his head to the rhythm of the song. In front of him, several children gathered, dancing, laughing, jumping about. The man who brought the news of Eberes husbands death was Udoka, who ran the biggest clothing shop in the village. Hed been driving to Enugu, in his Peugeot 504 wagon, when he came upon the scene of the accident and discovered that the life it had claimed was that of his kinsman. Ebere took a second look at Udoka, smartly dressed in a blue polo shirt tucked into sharply ironed brown pants. His gold wristwatch shimmered in the morning sun, and Ebere thought his half-cut black leather shoe resembled a pair her husband used to own. Youre telling me that my husband is dead? Ebere asked him, My husband? Udoka reiterated that Eberes husband had indeed been killed and that he was very sorry. Ebere screamed. A scream so loud that it startled the women chattering around the cooking pot. Some of them had wondered what a busy man like Udoka had come to do at the venue of a childs birthday party, and so early in the day. Quickly, the women rallied around Ebere. One of them stayed back to attend to their cooking, but even she could not keep her eyes from Ebere, wondering what the matter was. After Ebere, crying, had reported what Udoka had told her, the women shuffled about, confused. There was the food they were cooking to celebrate a birthday party and there was the father of the celebrant whod just died. They decided to gather their wits and act fast. Some led Ebere inside, stopping her from pulling at her hair as shed started to. One of them asked the lone cooking woman to continue cooking; that way, at least Ebere would have something to eat now that, in this condition, she would not be able to cook anything. Then, they asked the DJ to stop playing, asked everyone to return to their houses while the rest of them piled into that red bungalow. Ebere would need all the company she could get. Over the three months that Ebere mourned Ndukas death, she, as was customary, wore the same depressing outfit of a black wrapper, a black blouse, and a small black scarf wound around her head. She kept to her house. She visited neither friends nor went to the market. Being the vivacious person that she was, she could not wait for all of it to end. And the day it came to an end, one fine sunny morning, she took her daughter to school first, then upon her return home, she sat out on the veranda and polished her nails. Wearing a bright purple flowery gown, she was happy that she could finally put on makeup. What she could not have accounted for was the plan her mother-in-law had just initiated. That morning, as she polished her nails, Ebere heard the door-gate of the compound creak open and watched as her mother-in-law lumbered in. Theyd never liked each other, Ebere and her mother-in-law. The woman believed her son married a girl who came from dishonorable family: whose father had been banished from the village for siphoning the money meant for the extension of the villages electricity project, and whose mother and siblings had joined the man of the house on exile, except for Ebere, who stayed back because shed never supported her fathers thieving ways. Ebere, on the other hand, had never liked her mother-in-law, because she could not see what she, Ebere, had specifically done to the woman to incur so much hatred from her. However, Mother-in-Law said that a person was as good as the family they came from. Since Ebere did not agree with such logic, the animosity between both women raged underneath, paved over by Ndukas love for both his wife and his mother. Now that Nduka was dead, Ebere could tell that all that animosity was finally about to erupt from the bowels of the earth and destroy the world as she knew it. Already painting your nails, ehn? Mother-in-Law said, as she labored up the steps of the veranda. I bet you couldnt even wait for all of it to come to an end so you could again put on your dresses and remind everyone that youre still so beautiful. Do you have a problem with that? Ebere did not take her eyes off the nail she was polishing. Mother-in-Law sighed, shook her head, then said, Thats what you have to say to your mother-in-law who left her house to visit you this early morning? Should I dance instead? I beg you, Mama, I dont have time for your troubles this morning. My troubles? I see. Well, Ive come to inform you of a serious matter. Yesterday, the elders met and decided thatare you even listening to me? Im listening to you. Good. So, the elders and I have decided that you have to meet another man. Ebere sat up. For a while, she stared at Mother-in-Law, the old womans mass of gray hair pulled into a tight bun, her right hand resting on one of the pillars of the veranda for support. Since Mother-in-Law was also staring at Ebere, it seemed both women were using up the silence to let the message Mother-in-Law had just delivered simmer, that and to consider how it would change both of their lives. You people decided that I have to meet another man. Ebere repeated what Grandmother had said, as if tasting its realness on her lips, then she laughedhysterically. But you know I cannot do that, Mama. She laughed again because it was all so ridiculous. Mama, are you serious: me, meet another man? Do you people know what year this is? We are not living in my grandmothers time anymore. And she laughed again. Mother-in-Law watched Ebere make a joke of it all, wondering how best to take charge of the situation. Ebere, this is a serious matter. And I am serious that it is a joke. I beg you, Mama, I have to enjoy my first day out visiting friends. Dont ruin it for me. With that, Ebere took leave of Mother-in-Law on the veranda. She went inside to retouch her makeup. Done, she put on some perfume and went to visit her friend, Ifeoma. Unlike Ebere, Ifeoma did not think the demand was ridiculous. They were sitting in Ifeomas artistic living room, as Ebere once called it. A mural of the great Margaret Ekpo, power-fist in the air and all, rose against a white-painted wall. A red Persian rug bore the weight of three brown armchairs and a sofa arranged in an arc. And after Ifeoma had served Ebere a bottle of soft drink and had listened to her ordeal, she thought that although the year was 2002, a new millennium should have no bearing on the longevity of important cultural practices. All those centuries ago, the elders of the land converged at the sacred grove of Ezumezu. There, they made several pronouncements, struck their ofors to the earth, and with that, every pronouncement became a law binding every son and daughter of Imeokute. If they said that a woman like Ebere whod not given her late husband a son, if they said a woman like Ebere must then sleep with a married man whose wife must give her consent, if they said such a man should father a son with Ebere, a son who would be born in the name of Eberes dead husbandhe was the only surviving son of his own fatherto continue the dead husbands lineage, because only sons could continue a mans line, if they said all of this, why should the new millennium matter? How sad a mans spirit would be in the land of the ancestors if he had no surviving son to pour libations in his name! Wait, Ifeoma, are you saying that I should do it? Thats not what Im saying. Im only saying that you may not like your mother-in-law, but it doesnt mean that shes wrong this time. As far as Im concerned, she will always be wrong. And if you decide to join these people in bullying me, you will also be wrong to me. You better be reasonable, Ebere. And where do you think youre going? My house, of course, since you obviously dont want me here. At least, thank God my daughter and I have a roof over our heads, that we do not have to depend on any of you. You better be reasonable, Ebere. Im saying this as a friend. Dont try to go to the police with this matter. Youre not going to win it like the house incident. Standing by the door, Ebere laughed and laughed. I fought for my husband to include my name in the deed of our house and thats the only reason it is mine now, or some far-flung, random relative of my husbands would have come to claim it, because I dont have a son. That may have made my mother-in-law further hate me. I dont care. I will do whatever I can to make sure that someone does not use my body for some bloody cultural experiment. What the fuck do you mean by a cultural experiment? And you leave the law you studied in school out of this. This has nothing to do with the constitution. What the elders of the land did at the sacred grove of Ezumezu and the constitution are two different things. I can help you look for a man. It wont take anything from you if you just stopped looking at things condescendingly. The man fathers a son with you and thats all, and you go back to living your life. You dont have to fight everything, my dear. Im sorry that that is precisely the point of my training: fighting against anything I dont think is right. With that, Ebere walked out of Ifeomas living room, banging the door behind her. That night, after Ebere had put her daughter to sleep, after shed had her bath and creamed her arms and face, she sat on her bed and cried. There was no electricity so a blast of wind from the window was busy unsettling the flame of the candle she had placed on her dresser. She propped up the hard cover of a book with a jar of cream to barricade off the wind from the candle, then her eyes came upon the picture frame of her late husband on the dresser. She picked it up, stared at it, at the handsome man shed married. In those days when they first got married, Nduka would drive home from work in the middle of a sweltering afternoon. Wherever he found Ebere, he would lift her up in his arms, despite her protestations, while laughing about the meal she was cooking or the laundry she was leaving unattended. Hed hurry with her into their bedroom where theyd have passionate sex. Many times, Ebere would come out of their bedroom to the smell of burning food. These episodes became so frequent that some neighbors started buying Ebere and her husband bunches of banana and roasted groundnuts; they said it helped that bedroom exercise go smoothly. Nduka used to laugh because their neighbors probably thought he was bloated with excess libido. But are you not? Ebere would laugh.  It was a standing joke that Nduka had never had sex until he married Ebere. Not because he was religious or anything of the sort; he was simply too busy building his quarry business that he did not have time for women until he met Ebere, whom he loved with his life, and whom you want to kill with sex, Ebere would add, teasing him whenever hed started to praise himself for having stayed a virgin for his wife. Ebere herself was not a virgin, but Nduka did not mind. He loved her. He particularly liked how feisty she could be. Her energetic spirit went beyond being a lawyer. She was simply born to fight whenever she perceived that something was wrong. But she did not fight it when he, Nduka, asked if she could resign from the law firm where she worked at in Enugu. It was too far from their village where he was building his quarry, and there was no law firm in their villageor even the prospect of getting clients there. He asked if he could set up a grocery shop for Ebere in their village; Ebere did not fight it. She loved Nduka so much, and for the five years that they were married, she felt swaddled in his love. He was a good man. Now, Ebere dropped the picture frame back on the dresser. The wind had picked up, thrashing the curtain about the window. Ebere was so tired that she blew out the candle and went to bed. When she woke up, she decided shed do itfor Ndukas sake. The man Mother-in-Law chose for Ebere was called Ibe, an old man but a trusted one when it came to the good job of fathering sons. A retired soldier, Ibe was the father of six sons, all tall and all very handsome. Mother-in-Law said he would shoot a boy into Eberes womb before the next Eke market day. Ebere failed to see the joke. She just stared at Mother-in-Law, as if the old woman was blabbering in a language shed never heard. As per Ifeomas instructions, Ebere tried not to think too much of Ibes wrinkled skin or that he often smelled of cheap gin. If he could give her a son, none of that would matter. So every Tuesday and Thursday evenings, Ebere would welcome Ibe into her bed. Before intercourse, she would serve him either akpu or garri with some freshly prepared soup. Although Ibe preferred onugbu soup, Ebere sometimes took the liberty of serving him ofe egusi or ofe ogbono. She knew that this was not the type of person she was, that she was not a calculating person, one who traded off something of herself for gain. But Ifeoma said it was important that she stopped being conceited for once in her life. And she did her best to be. But when the child came, it was a girl, a squalling little girl who had her fathers puffy face rather than Eberes high cheekbones. For two days, Ebere did not touch the girl, neither did she breastfeed her. It took the intervention of Mother-in-Lawwho took care of the child all alongand some of the elders before Ebere was plucked from the depths of her mind into which shed sunk. She could not believe the state to which shed fallen: a brilliant lawyer whod always believed in her completeness as a human being and for that reason, did not need a man to complete her. When Nduka had thrown money her way, shed told him that she neither needed his money nor did she feel incomplete without a man in her life. If he couldnt show her that he loved her and could complement her, she did not want him in her life. Now, how did that person become this woman who had slept with an old, rickety man because she wanted to birth a son? How did that person become this woman whose first impulse was to hiss when she was told shed birthed a girl? It was shame at her reaction to the birth of her second daughter that prevented her from touching the girl. In her present state of mind, she didnt feel worthy to be the girls mother. But she did forgive herself, and over the next months, she nursed her daughter with overwhelming love. The one promise she made to herself was this: if she ever again tried to have a son, she would do it on her terms: choose the man. Two years later, Ebere met him. She was locking up her grocery shop at the marketplace, ready to go and pick up her eldest daughter from school, the same school where Ifeoma worked part-time as an arts teacher, when she could spare some time from her art studio. Eberes second daughter was with Mother-in-Law. Sorry, are you about to lock up? Ebere turned to look at the man whod just spoken such impeccable English. He was tall and light-skinned, not handsome by Ndukas standards, but he looked well-off. Sorry, I was told that yours is the only shop where I can find everything I need. Laughing now, he said, That woman over there said youd like that I speak supri-supri. I take that to mean that I speak English. Ebere smiled. Yes, she meant that you speak English so eloquently. Youre not from around here, are you? Oh, my wife is from this village, but I am from Uruagu, Nnewi. We moved here because this village has one of the best quarries in the country. I own one of the sites up there. Oh, my late husband used to own one there, too. Of course, that was before the boom of the last two years. Im sorry about that. But were not making a fortune as some people think. Ebere smiled. Okay, what do you want to buy? Your purchase would tell me if youre indeed making a fortune or not. The man laughed nervously, the laughter of someone whod been caught in the act. Just some beverages for my wife. She has some expensive tastes. Ah, there, Ebere joked, smiling. She helped the man with his purchase: tins of milk, tea, sardines; boxes of sugar, cornflakes, etc. When Ebere visited Ifeoma that evening, she told Ifeoma that shed found the man with whom shed again try to have a son. This time around, Ifeoma had changed the sitting arrangement of her living room. The three armchairs sat in a straight line, the sofa placed in front of them, the arrangement resembling that of a classroom. From the lone teacher-like sofa, Ifeoma, carrying Eberes sleeping toddler, stared at Ebere in disbelief. You found a man, Ebere? What do you mean by you found a man? Oluebube, stop playing with Aunty Ifeomas paint, Ebere said to her eldest daughter who was standing in front of Ifeomas worktable, now opening a bottle of green pastel color and running her color-covered index finger across her lower lip.  Biko, leave the girl alone, Ifeoma said. Oluebube, look at me. The girl turned and Ifeoma said, Puuurfect! You look amazing. See, Mummy, five-year-old Oluebube preened, Aunty Ifeoma does not mind. She shrugged and turned back to the set of pastel colors. Turning from the girl to Ebere, Ifeoma said, Ehen, I still dont understand what you mean when you say you found a man. Ebere, you have no business finding a man yourself. It is improper. The elders, all those centuries ago, knew how dangerous it would be for a woman in your predicament to have to find her own man. Ifeoma, I beg you, Im tired of hearing about the elders and the lousy staffs they struck on the earth and what they pronounced. I just want to be happy. And thats the point, cant you see? What you need is a man to give you a son, not one to make you happy. Cant you see how terrible it would be for the wife if you sought her husband to make you happy? Happiness should be out of the question. Oh, wow! So I dont deserve to be happy? You do. But you must defer that until you have a son, then you can do whatever you want. Ebere could not believe it. Stop looking at me like that, biko, Ifeoma shrugged, re-knotting the ends of her braid with a rubber band. Look, she said, I have always taken it upon myself to keep you grounded, because you can often give yourself over to these fantastical thoughts. Now, I beg you, Ebere, you have to be real here. I can see already that you like this man, and thats already a problem. Regardless of Ifeomas reservations, she, Ifeoma, told no one that it was Ebere who had chosen Bonaventure. What she said was that it was she, Ifeoma, whod chosen Bonaventure for Ebere. And truly, it was Ifeoma who went to speak to Bonaventures wife, Florence, on behalf of Ebere. Ifeoma and Florence had gone to primary school together and had struck some sort of friendship before Florences family moved to Nnewi. Since Florence did not know Ebere, it was Ifeoma who attested to Eberes good character. And Florence was sad to see that a woman could be in the kind of situation in which she depended on other peoples husbands to be able to live peacefully. So she agreed and convinced her husband to help Ebere, and Bonaventure was happy to help, impressed as he was by that solitary encounter hed had with Ebere at her shop. With Bonaventure, Ebere decided to adopt the Tuesday-Thursday schedule shed kept with Ibe. Bonaventure, however, told her that she did not need to prepare him some food. It was insulting that he would have to be fed before they could have sexwhat kind of man did she think he was? She apologized that she was only being courteous. And although she was not one for cultural norms and the likes, she thought it was a warm gesture. While eating, they could use the time to talk, instead of him just coming over, walking into her bedroom and having sex with herthat would be odd. Bonaventure agreed with the logic, and Ebere said it was the only thing the ancient fathers had got right. What fathers? Ebere laughed and told him not to bother. Ifeoma would have gotten the joke. In the end, Bonaventure and Ebere agreed that heavy meals like akpu and garri, along with whatever soup, was out of the question. Bonaventure was a light eater so she could make him some rice; other times, a bowl of pepper soup or other light meals would do. He could never do without his wifes meals, which would mean that hed barely have space for some more food. But since conversations would have to be had, well, eat they must. Their conversations, from the beginning, were cordial. They found that their favorite topic was the administration of the state governor, Dr. Chimaroke Nnamani. Both of them agreed that he was a fairly good governor but a biased one, given how he was concentrating on attracting most of the developmental gains of the state to his hometown of Agbanithe state university, the federal law school, the air force secondary school, the private university, the dual carriage roadswhile the central road in Eberes village was still unpaved. Bonaventure said Dr. Nnamani needed to be more distributive of the states resources, like his counterpart in Delta State, James Ibori. My dream is to one day contest for a position in the state house of assembly, Ebere told Bonaventure. State legislative houses need fiery lawyers like me to make laws. Laws that can, for example, compel state governors to more distributive of the locations in which they spend the states resources. I think you would make a fine legislator, Bonaventure said. Bonaventure had meant to say it casually but the moment it dropped, he realized how intensely hed said it, as if he was suddenly passionate about the dreams of this woman whom he was simply supposed to give a son. Ebere, too, noticed how slightly Bonaventure flinched, as if embarrassed by what hed said. She knew hed started to be embarrassed by what was now a common suggestion: that he was taking care of Ebere; that he took her together with his wife to eat out at this or that restaurant, which he was not supposed to do, because it was not his job to take care of her. Even Florence had started to take issue with how much Bonaventure cared for Ebere. But not until that evening when Bonaventure casually mentioned how much he wanted to support Eberes dreams did she realize that something strange had happened: that a leopard had been found prowling Farm Road in daylight. It was now left for her to kill it or let it kill her. She decided on the former: she would kill it. That evening, in the cover of dusk, and with her children still at Mother-in-Laws where she always dropped them off on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Ebere ran to Ifeoma and told her that it was about time for her, Ebere, to stop taking that potion. She was now ready to get pregnant. Ifeoma who was frying some sliced plantain in her kitchen turned off the stove and turned to Ebere.  My goodness, Ebere, what is wrong with you? She went over to wash her hands at the sink. Didnt you say you wanted it to go on for quite some time, that you enjoyed his company and that if you became pregnant too soon, it would all come to an end? That was before he fell in love with me. Like you did? Dont be silly, Ifeoma. I merely liked and respected him. And now, are you not in love? Thats besides the point, Ifeoma. Jesus Christ! What I do does not matter; its what he does that matters. He cannot fall in love with me. I cannot do that to Florence. She has been more than generous to me. Well, dont you think the elders were right when they said that the woman cannot pick the man herself and that the man picked for her should be very old, like Ibe? Oh my goodness, Ifeoma, fuck the elders! Okay, fine. I will ask Gracey to give me the counter-potion. Lets hope you get pregnant soon and that its a boy so we can all rest because, honestly, Im tired. And you dont think I am? Well, you didnt seem to be when you wanted it to go on and on. So much for always rubbing it in my face that youre beyond being calculating. Perhaps the world gets at all of us after all. Well, fuck you. When has that stopped you from being my friend? That night, everything changed. Ebere was sleeping when the irritating honk of Ifeomas car woke her up. It was raining heavily. She checked the time: 3:38 am. Why would Ifeoma be about in her car at that time of the night? Ebere ran out into the front yard with an umbrella, opened the gate to let Ifeoma in. Soon, Ifeoma jumped out of her car and started to scream something Ebere could not hear, the words racing past her, deadened by the raging thunder. What is it? Ebere shouted, drawing close to the car to allow Ifeoma join her under the umbrella. I said, get the girls, Ifeoma said. Were leaving the village right now. Leaving the village? By now, they were on the veranda. What is happening? Bonaventure is dead, Ifeoma said. What? I said, Bonaventure is dead, Ifeoma shouted. And this is not a time to be shocked. I really dont know what the two of you discussed yesterday but it must have had an impact on him. The man just went up to his wife and told her that he loved you and would like to move in with you? What? Are you deaf or something? Well, Florence lost it. She had always had this violent streak even in primary school. She took the knife with which she was peeling some oranges and stabbed Bonaventure. My goodness! This is not the time for that. You better go and get the girls. Were leaving this village now. The only reason the mob has not arrived here already is because of this crazy rain. Theyre saying that allowing a young man like Bonaventure to father a son with you was malpractice. What do we do now? Foolish question, Ebere. I said, go and get the girls. Were leaving the village now. If were lucky, well already be in Agbani by the time they get here. Just as Ifeoma was driving out of the compound, Mother-in-Law came running towards the car, as if shed heard of what had happened and had come running down to check on her granddaughters and their mother, splashing about in the dark. Ebere! Ebere! Mother-in-Law was screaming, running after the car. Stop, stop, biko! Please, stop! Please, Ifeoma! Am I not begging you people? We should stop for her, please, Ebere said. Ifeoma did not stop. She sped on, meandering through the soaked unpaved streets of the village, racing towards the expressway. She knew she had to drive as fast as she could, and that was what she did. Ikechukwu Ogbu is a Nigerian writer who holds a BA in English language and literature from the University of Benin, Nigeria.

With a vision and visual vocabulary firmly rooted in tropical island coastlines, Cruet has been searching for the line where the sky meets the seaas far as the eyes can seeand has located something that reaches beyond small island realities.  Cruets use of aerial and low-angle views reflect a relationship between the local and the global: the sky seen from the ground in Puerto Rico, the oceans seen from far abovea meeting point between scientific technology and his artistic use of projectors, screens, and software. The images nestle on top of one another in layers like too many windows opened on your computer, or the climate studies that continue to pile up. His compositions, created from layers of aerial thermal images of the ocean, juxtapose warm and cold colors that signify changes in ocean temperatures. Each image challenges the idea of divided oceans, conceptualizing them instead as a single body of water threatened by the catastrophic effects of climate changepollution, global warming, extreme weather events, widespread erosion, population displacement, and ultimately, species extinction. Some elements are abstract, while others are easily recognizable: silhouettes of mangroves, backlit palm trees, sand, sea, someone looking up at the sky at sunset.  The prints incorporate Cruets imagery with infrared technology and satellite imaging, anchoring his aesthetic in empirically derived data. They disrupt traditional visualizations of the ocean, displacing blue for bright reds, oranges, and yellows to reference the increases in water temperature documented by researchers and demonstrated through scientific dataan alarming development that transcends geographical and political borders. For instance,   (2022) depicts global sea surface temperatures taken on August 27, 2003 by Japan National Space Development Agencys (NASDA) AMSR-E instrument aboard NASAs Aqua spacecraft. The original image depicts in false colors the surface water temperatures, which range from -2C (28F) in the darkest sections to 35C (95F) in the brightest yellow-white regions. Sea ice is depicted in white, while land is depicted in dark gray. Intermingling scientific imaging techniques with graphic design and other artistic sleights of hand, Cruet invites us to confront the emergency we have ignored and the catastrophes our denial has catalyzed, presenting us with a Caribbean that is not localized nor isolated, but part of an ecological crisis that is expansive, interconnected, and global.   JG Lionel Cruet  (b. San Juan, Puerto Rico) uses experimental digital printing processes, performance, and audiovisual installations to confront intersections of ecology, technology, and geopolitics. His solo exhibitions have been held at Bronx River Art Center and El Lobi, San Juan, and his work has been included in group exhibitions at Bronx Museum of the Arts and Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse. Cruet received the Juan Downey Audiovisual Award from the 11th Media Arts Biennale, National Museum of Fine Arts, Santiago, Chile. He has been an artist in residence at Elizabeth Foundation of the Arts, Socrates Sculpture Park, and the Laundromat Project (NY).  ",

        "text": "Art by Jeff Gauntt-Quiceno  Jeff Gauntt-Quiceno,  , 2023, soft pastel and graphite on paper, 51 x 42 in We were sipping coffee in front of a caf in Denver when my brother Tom mentioned his sugar daddy. A lady marched by with a pink yoga mat tucked under her arm like she was going to war. On the cracked sidewalk, a group of pigeons converged over a decimated muffin. I spat my coffee back into the porcelain mug. Like a pimp? I asked. I scanned Toms bony body for bruises. He stopped working out after our father died. A scratch near his thinning hair, but he looked like he always doespale, hairy, and sick.  Not a pimp, he said casually. More like a friend. His narrow eyes fixed on another yogi entering the building. I checked my phone4 p.m. Must be time for the afternoon flow. Tom lit a cigarette and folded his hands behind his head and leaned back in the metal chair while my heart raced.  I knew youd freak out, he said. He flexed his foot and kicked the muffin wad onto the street and the pigeons scurried behind. I leaned forward, planted my elbows on the table and rested my chin on my hands. Im not, I said. A bus honked and the mess of pigeons exploded into the air. I just need you to explain.   I was in the sixth grade and Tom was in the eighth when he got his first hand job.  What was it like? I asked into the dark bedroom, as the window fan blew cool air from his side of the room to mine. After his voice dropped last summer, I stopped peeing at the same time as him when we woke up on Saturday mornings. The best feeling you could imagine, he said. He slapped his stomach to imitate the sounds of a fast hand job and let out a fake moan. I giggled and muffled my face in my pillow. Moms faint snores carried from across the hall. Howd you get her to do it? I asked. I thought of Sara Jacobs looking down at her shoes and shaking her head when I asked her to dance to Brian McKnight at the sixth-grade social. We were in the stall in the locker room near the showers, he said. The one no one uses. And? And she kind of justgrabbed it. I felt my small prepubescent penis grow stiff.  Whatd she say? I asked. He paused. The silence in the room was thick.  Oh my.  We erupted into laughter and I buried my face in the pillow, but it was too late. Moms heavy footsteps thumped down the hall. I pulled the blankets over my head and fake-snored as she swung open the door. Amidst the threats of grounding and no television, I felt Toms radiant smile.  After Mom left the room, Tom got out of bed and stood in front of the computer by the desk. The webcam glowed red, and the white light from the screen illuminated his naked skin. I saw his body transposed onto the screen and then he clicked the mouse and a fake camera sound echoed from the speakers. He opened up AOL Instant Messenger and typed furiously before sending the photo. Then the screen went black, and I heard him shuffle into bed. His body made a silhouette in the faint streetlight. Jeff Gauntt-Quiceno,  , 2022, collaged paint swatches, graphite, acrylic on wood panel, 20 x 16 in When Tom and I walked through the glass doors to Eliot Middle School the next Tuesday, I slipped and caught myself on his shoulder. A thin layer of computer paper covered the floor. Sara Jacobs held a piece in the air like a trophy and ran down the hall laughing. By the time I looked down and recognized Toms face and naked body, his name was being called over the PA system.   The system screeched and I covered my ears. Then, I felt the breeze from the open door behind me and heard the door click shut. I turned and saw Tom sprint across the courtyard, up the concrete steps, and disappear behind a bush.  Your brothers a freak, Sara Jacobs said to me. She stood with her hands on her waist and one hip splayed to the side. I bet youre the same way.  I stared back at her with such hatred that her cocky, metal-picket smile dissolved, and she looked down and picked a cuticle. Then she crumpled the paper, threw it at my chest and ran away. I burst out the door and across the courtyard, until I found Tom crying in a bush. That night I lay on my bed, as my brother stuffed an Adidas duffel bag with sweatpants and hoodies and plotted his escape. I heard the dial-up modem downstairs, as Mom sent emails to regional boarding schools, begging them to take my brother midyear. I heard the front door open and then heavy feet up the stairs. My father burst through the bedroom door, and Tom pulled the cloth belt off of his bathrobe. What the fuck is wrong with you? my dad bellowed. He waved a picture of Toms naked body in the air like a headline from the morning paper. He still wore his surgical scrubs from the hospitalhair cap and all. Tom gritted his teeth and tied a slipknot around his neck and pulled until his face was a fleshy pink. My dad lunged forward, and Tom pulled harder on either end. My dad wrestled the rope with his calculated hands and worked his hairy fingers between the belt and my brothers neck. He looked like he was performing surgeryforehead scrunchedeyes focused and firm. Toms face was purple, and he released his grip and pummeled my dads chest with tiny punches.  My dad finally broke the knot and pulled the belt so fast that it cut through the air like a whip. I felt my teeth chatter. He crumpled the cloth belt into his fist and shook it in the air. The naked photo lay on the floor between them. What made you like this? he yelled. His voice was high and frantic.  Mom emerged and brushed past my father and shielded Tom. She rubbed his back as he bent over and breathed. His face went from purple, to red, to pink, and settled there. Then he stood up and shoved her. I leapt to my feet as she stumbled backwards and fell into the closet door. She looked up at her thirteen-year-old sonwide-eyed and afraid.  That summer I waited on my bed for Tom to get home from boarding school on the Greyhound bus. He barely looked at me when he walked into our bedroom. His hair was buzzed and he had glass stud earrings. His forearm muscles bulged like he had lifted weights. He pulled boxes from the closet. Where are you going? I asked. To the basement, he said. I cant share a room with a kid. Jeff Gauntt-Quiceno,  , 2022, collaged paint swatches, pencil, crayon, acrylic on wood panel 48 x 36 in The yoga class let out, and the chatty women with their Easter-egg mats poured onto the sidewalk and made plans for happy hour. Tom flicked his cigarette across the sidewalk and it bounced into a storm drain. Hes a nice guy, he explained. A doctor actually. I looked up. A cloud passed over the sun, but it was thin and wispy and did nothing to block its rays. Denver was known for three hundred sunny days per year. I cleared my throat. How does it work? I asked. I see him once a month, Tom said. He shrugged his shoulders in a nonchalant way. And he sends me money. Rent? I asked Tom nodded as he lit another smoke. Hed been living in the South End of Boston for a year now without a job.  It was stupid but the tears welled in my eyes and I remembered finding Tom in a bush behind the courtyard crying after the photos leaked. He sobbed into his palms.  Everyones going to hate me, he said. I draped an arm around him, and we waited until the principal passed the lot, before running home. Tom leaned forward and raised my chin with a single finger. Im kidding, he said. I looked up and that warm smile returned to his face. His pupils nearly vanished in the Denver sun.  Me? With a sugar daddy? He leaned back and slapped his knee. I laughed too, and the tears kept coming. What kind of guy do you think I am?  For a second his eyes got sad and he glanced towards the street, but the pigeons were gone, and only the muffin wrapper remained. Then he forced a smile, flattened out a crumpled ten-dollar bill with his palm, and pinned it under the weight of the mug.  Come on, he said. I want to see your new apartment. I didnt fly out to Denver for nothing.  He draped a frail arm around me, and I rested my head on his shoulder as we walked down the street. His stained undershirt smelled like our old room. Back in my apartment, I said he could sleep on the couch or I could blow up the air mattress for him in my bedroom. I remembered the late-night talks, the window fan, Moms hushed whispers, and the streetlight strewn across his sleeping body. I prayed hed choose the latter.

        "author": "Nancy Jainchill",
        "text": "Images courtesy of Erika Lust Marlene, a sixtyish divorce without prior porn-star creds, arrives on the set with an array of hard-earned skills, though one of them isnt finagling a condom over the soft penis of a stranger. A behind-the-scenes tutorial before the shoot shows her how to use her mouth while sucking hard on the rubber. Produced by sex educator  Joan Price  and by adult performer Jessica Drake, this particular film (\" Guide to Wicked Sex: Senior Sex \") features two couples who are ordinary people, not hot porn stars. Marlene and Galen (the man with the soft penis) are meeting for the first time.  The film is to be a hybrid between shame-free, nonjudgmental factual information and graphic visual eroticism, showing the over-sixty set that were still sexy no matter what we think or how we feelor how we look. As Price said, If were sexually empowered we feel differently about ourselves. We move in the world differently. Its never just some act done on a bed.  As Marlene and Galen are being prepped by makeup and hair artists, it strikes me how average they look. It hasnt been easy for the producers to find everyday folks above a certain agereal people who arent already erotic professionals. But theyve found a few volunteers and Im learning in real time that its never too late to get butt naked for the camera.  In this movie, Price and Drake want to use the tricks of their trade to teach seniors how to outsmart bad knees, back problems, dry vaginas, and floppy dicks in order to have a viable sex life. Were taught not to like our bodies from the beginning, Price tells me. As we get older we find more reasons to dislike them.  Ive always wanted to move differently in the world. Then again, as a feminist, Ive never been able to reconcile the goals of feminism and sexual freedom. Certainly, accepting myself has become more difficult as my body has morphed over the years. Yet, the early porn feminists Ive been studying teach that the right to pleasureat any ageis key to gender parity. Im hoping that seeing it happen right in front of me will be transformative. Bonnie and Joel, 70 and 69 years old respectively, have been together for a long time. They love sex and they love each other and they are happy to share their love with the world. At this point in their lives, they have a quiet kind of love. They sure dont look like theyd be the type to offer workshops with a group called Life on the Swing Set, including lessons on squirting, the release of fluidusually urinefrom the vagina during orgasm. They dont seem like the sort of couple whod be vacationing at the Desire Resortclothing optional. Public nudity and sex isnt new to them, although theyve never done it professionally. Whereas Bonnie wonders about how many people are going to be focused on her pussy, Joel is concerned about erectile dysfunction. He says that hes put this opportunity to the end of life test. How will he feel if he passes up the chance to have a celluloid sex adventure? Though the prospect is scary, they both agree: Lets do it. With a tattoo of a scorpion on his left upper arm, long white hair, and a full beard, Joel looks like an aging biker. Defying his appearance, he is soft-spoken, more tender than gruff, and  open about how age is impacting him sexually. He doesnt always ejaculate when he comes and staying hard is difficult. Wearing a floral shirtwaist dress, Bonnie looks like a perky grandma. Yet her black panties are the first Ive ever seen with a clit slit. Aside from fibromyalgia, she has a bad back which can compromisemaybe a better word is tailorwhat they can do. He loves watching me with a vibrator, she says a sizeable piece of equipment called a Magic Wand that is meant for external use only. Her other favorite toy is an eroscillator, the only sex gadget endorsed by Dr. Ruth. When Joel lubes her uplube is ever presentand wields the eroscillator, she warns him that the shoot might come to an early climax. Writhing with pleasure, theres no evidence of her former pre-performance anxiety and she seems oblivious to the audience. Joel switches to the Magic Wand and smiles as Bonnie exclaims, Right there, oh oh oh FUCKand then, I think thats enough for now. After all, the shoot has just begun. To introduce the next segment, Joan offers a tutorial about penises. If PIV (penis in vagina) sex isnt working for you, she says to let it go. You dont need an erection to feel good. And dont be goal-oriented. Kind of like practicing mindfulness, settling into the foreplay.  Bonnie returns to the set after a break. She has changed her lingerie and is wearing thigh-high fishnet hose. Joel has untied his hair and arrives with whatunder his clothingappears to be an erection. He tells the audience that hes abstained for three days to assure that hell be able to perform. Bonnies fishnet stockings are the only clothes she keeps on. When she is about to comewhen her pussy is juiced-up and ready for the PIV momentJoel puts on a cock ring to facilitate a stronger and longer-lasting erection. This is a show-and-tell moment for the viewer. An instructional opportunity. Joel and Bonnie laugh a lot and they dont take themselves too seriously. Their relationship could be a model for many seniors who feel particularly vulnerable about their bodies and their sexuality. Showing off her cropped hair, rolls of flesh, and flabby upper arms, Bonnie is extremely comfortable with herself on camera. Essential for their sexual success, Bonnie and Joel actually talk about their needs and wants, instead of merely relying on pantomime, habit, or silent innuendoes. For Bonnie the transition from spontaneous desire (always ready and wet) to responsive desire (needing more coaxing) is notable but not insurmountable. The soft, tender moments they share have as much of an impact as the more explicit demonstrations. Looking at them and seeing all the same imperfections that I see in myself is jarring. To embrace who we are out in the openas opposed to with the lights out and under the coversis sexy as hell. Thats my takeaway so far. Marlene and Galen are meeting for the first time on set. Joan Price discovered both of them. Both single, they are very sexually active. For Marlene, solo sex is like a gift to herself. She sets time aside for masturbationwith music, candles, and sex toys. This is her escape from the rest of the world. Her commitment to pleasure is obvious. She is fully at ease with every part of being made camera ready. Wearing a short red dress with spaghetti straps, she says she is surprised at how relaxed she feels. She talks about how the interplay of fear and excitement can be arousing. For Marlene, sex was once extremely vanilla. Kink has been a game changer. The challenge is finding men who know how to make her feel good. She has learned how to speak up for herself, how to be clear about what works or what doesnt. This has been critical to getting what she wants. She says she is even more active and comfortable with her own sexuality now than when she was younger, which makes her a model for showing how desire and desirability dont have to tank as we age. She says shes gained confidence from her years of experience.  Galen thinks of himself as a wild elder whose mission is to stamp out the shame surrounding sex. He talks about the depths of eros that women have shared with him from the dungeon to the bedroom. Though dealing with ED, he focuses on the range of opportunities for pleasure, including bondage, emphasizing the world of possibility that extends beyond PIV sex. When they are asked what they hope that seniors might learn from their film, they say they want others to know that our sexuality is innate and that it is a birthright without an expiration date. They insist that being open and honest about our sexuality exposes us to deepening intimacy and arousal. Though theyve each been tested for a range of diseases prior to meeting, Galen uses a dental dama square of latex originally designed for dentiststo perform cunnilingus. Holding the dam in place so that it wont slip off can be tricky. Galen is a pro at keeping the dam secure while delivering pleasure through it. When its Marlenes turn to reciprocate, she is equally dedicated to getting Galen hard.  Youd never know they were strangers until a few hours earlier. How have they pulled off appearing to really care about each other? Marlenes enthusiasm is contagious. Im not going to sit back and not do things, she says. I did that for too many years. When she and Galen return for round two shes wearing the best getup Ive ever seen, a black teddy with blue roses that wraps around her neck, black stockings with a lace border, and fuck me stilettos. I worry about those stilettos. One unintentional misstep would put Galen in the hospital. Producing a vibrator the size of a small baseball bat, he spanks her with a flogger used as much for teasing as for slapping. Her pleasure seems limitless, and I lose count of how many orgasms she has. Her squirting makes Galen happy. Marlene makes me wonder about my own limits.  These brave couples offer us a window into real life senior sexuality. The nature of the overwhelming waves that carry us to orgasmalmost impossible to put into wordsmay change as we age, but that doesnt mean that they ebb. In fact, Marlenes and Bonnies pleasure hardly seems muted. Women may have the advantage herethey dont need much preparation to be ready.  Dont wait for the mood to strike, Price advises. Climaxing may take more time, she says, but usually youll get there. In the next segment, Price and Drake had planned to take us on a journey into solo sexual exploration. However, the talent scheduled to demonstrate this potential for personal fulfillment mustve had second thoughts about conveying the belief that solo sex is real sex. They dont show up. Is this my big break?  I once did a loop porn movie in my twenties thats always caused me shame and regret.  Is this my chance to reverse my failed star turn, rescuing my past self with a new attitude? Solo sex isnt trivial. Most everyone engages in some kind of autoerotic pleasure. Im not asked to fill in. The shoot goes on. John and Annie. Photo: Adriana Eskenazi John and Annie are another nonprofessional couple guiding anybody interested into the world of senior porn. In their movie  , they talk about how a climax is irrelevant to a truly fulfilling connection. To get their movie made, they approached Erika Lust, a progressive producer of adult entertainment, and showed her their websitea place where they share their own emotional and sexual renaissance with others. She saw the significance of their process and she knew she had to film them, hoping their story would contribute to normalizing senior sex. At the time, John was seventy-three and Annie was sixty-nine.   went viral, appearing in newspapers, on Snapchat, and in other media outlets. Annies nephew, who lives in Thailand, saw clips of the film and alerted her that shed made it around the world. John and Annie didnt realize how famous Lust would make them.  The formality of a professional movie set and crew was too much for Johns penis which, Annie said, went into hiding and became a little cherry. A soft penis wasnt a major concern. They looked at the event as amazingly liberating. Sex is a spiritual act for John and Annie, a symbolic attempt to connect with the divine by focusing on the non-physical part of us. Yet, how can sex not be physical? A neuroscientist by training, Annie offers a different understanding of what happens during sexual activity. The oxytocin secreted during physical contact keeps you young, Annie explains. It puts collagen in your skin and takes away the wrinkles. On top of that, getting naked is freeing, with or without Erika Lust filming you. The way weve been trained to make love, typically oriented on performance, is stress-inducing,  says Annie. The addiction circuits are triggered so that you need more excitement to get the same pleasure. Sooner or later nothing works. So whats the solution?  . Its not just a movie: its their approach to making love. In an interview for Spanish television, the host is dumbstruck when John and Annie undress to demonstrate their discoveries, specifically how Annie puts Johns unerect penis inside of her. They call it a pop-in. After the program, they receive ninety thousand hits on Instagram. A lot of people have been involved with a limp penisthere are no age restrictionsand going public suggests that youre not alone and youre okay. Whats important is connectionslow, easy, and bondingand understanding the difference between orgasmic pleasure and climax. Orgasmic pleasure can be an ongoing feelingclimax, on the other hand, is an endgame. With John and Annie, theres no flogging or ropes. Theres no tension. I wonder if some people would find soul sex boring. Although, like Annie says, theres no element of sex that might not become boring eventually.   John and Annie. Photo: Adriana Eskenazi John, more vocal about his pleasure than Annie, almost seems surprised at how good he feels. When I bring up this imbalanceabout how so much of their focus is on Johns little cherryAnnie assures me that shes simply more quiet about her pleasure. Off-screen, the couple makes love every morning and then sometimes again later in the day.  Having the vagina and the penis together is like magic, Annie says. They talk to each other.  Serious explorations like John and Annies into the world of senior eroticism are actually rather rare. More often, age is a fetish. OnlyFans is the most successful of the platforms that feature self-produced contentcontent that can be individualized to satisfy a particular customer. According to an article in  , some of the hottest OnlyFans models are also the most mature. Specific ages arent readily available and admittedly, MILFsMothers Id Like to Fuckcan run the gamut from forty-something onward.  What about more traditional adult movies? While Nina Hartley may be the most well-known woman over sixty out there sucking cock or playing with her pussy, shes hardly alone. Seniors as actors in films with no other purpose than to be pornographic are becoming increasingly visible. MILFsand Momare among the ten most popular search terms on major porn sites. Because boys still want their mothers? Or because older women can still be hot?  Stories that showcase older women present them as more assertive sexually and more accomplished in other ways than in films with younger talent, satisfying men who want to submit and satisfying women with power fantasies.  Such scripts often reflect a feminist message in the narrative. For example, Mrs. Claus, a MILF icon, is at the top of the charts at XXXmas time, with porn plots that depict her tired of being left behind while Santa is off sliding down other peoples chimneys. Described by a Toronto-based producer of adult entertainment as one of the few representations of fat women in fictional media that is positive, she can be nurturing and safe, but can also provide spankings upon request. Finding her independence through sex, she is an unlikely feminist figure. At age sixty-seven, the adult actress Erica Lauren is old enough to collect social security. Still, she works. She doesnt have to: she has an MBA. Beginning her career at forty-nine, she has mainly been cast in MILF/cougar roles. Always smiling, a page of screenshots shows her caressing herself, sucking cock, licking pussy, and in a threesome.   is a series focused on the enduring beauty and sexuality of elder adult cinema talent. Lauren is probably the oldest of the females in this series, which features performers ranging in age from 53 to 65 at the time of filming. Each episode has a storyline that involves a younger man being seduced by someone old enough to be his mother: a former teacher, a friend of his parents from childhood, or a client receiving services through a senior care program. The sex is as explicit as films with a younger cast, with a lot of sucking, some anal activity, and always the grand finale of a climax. Only one of the scenarios did anything for me. Instead, some of what took place made me squirm. Perhaps it is a mirror to my own vulnerability, to the changes which arent easy for me to accept. A number of  the faces seemed to have had as much work done on them as the boobs, countering the example of self-acceptance. Magdalene St. Michaels Magdalene St. Michaels was also forty-nine years old when she entered the world of adult cinema, attending the AVN Expothe largest pornography convention and trade show in the United Statesjust for fun with her husband. At the Girlfriends Films booth, the owner told her he was looking for a MILF. After completing an application, she walked away from that booth reborn. Since then, St. Michaels has been busy nonstop, initially doing mostly girl/girl scenarios. At sixty, she starred in  , a four-part production where she plays a professor who returns to teaching after her husbands death and becomes involved with a student. The story line touches on real life issues more common to seniors: the feeling of becoming old overnight after becoming a widow, and the complications wrought by the age difference between her and the student. I want to be with you, but you have to let me grow up, the student says. St. Michaels is convincing. Shes erotic. Her lush body invites touch. She looks real.  After watching Magdalene St. Michaels I went into the bedroom, and did what any cougar would do. Lying across the bed, I took deep breaths, working to relax, focusing on the image of her lying back against the pillows, her thighs open, smiling at me as she fingered her clitoris.  Still from  Its possible that becoming sexually empoweredat any agecauses us to inhabit the world differently because we inhabit ourselves differently. Beyond the bed, we move in the world with assurance, with a sense of belonging.  As it turns out, being rebornparticularly for older womenis en vogue. In  , Emma Thompson plays a retired schoolteacher and widow who hires a sex worker because shes never had an orgasm. At the end, she faces herself in a full-length mirror nakeda witness to her changesand modeling self-acceptance. My own body also displays the impact of time. All the same, I still see traces of the young woman whose breasts were always important to her. I think about what this younger version of me did to know her own sexual liberation, including the topless dancing and the porno flick. Ive finally let go of the shame that went with the societal scorn for sex workers, and the personal shame from dancing naked onstage at the North Beach San Francisco strip club. Todays seniorslike mecame of age during the sexual revolutionour revolution. We were intent on liberating ourselves as sexual beings. But we also bought into the premise that women didnt experience pleasure. We werent schooled in how to achieve it and therefore we didnt expect or demand it. How often did our partners pleasure come first? For decades, my sisters and I were at a loss.  Letting go of body-shame is critical to true feminismand to seniorswhove been characteristically dismissed in any real public conversation about sex. Above a certain age were supposed to be done with getting off. Now Marlenes, Bonnies, and Anniesand, yes, Emma Thompsonsare accepting their senior bodies and rewriting the narrative, making space for women who arent Ericas, Ninas, or Magdalenes. Personal identity and ones sense of self is under assault as we age. Losing a sense of ourselves as sexual beings makes it worse. Are we about to see a senior sexual revolution as well as a second feminist revolution? As I embrace the message to stay in touch with touching, these women are role models for me. But not only for me. Nancy Jainchill  is a practicing psychologist living in upstate NY. Her writing focuses on issues of feminism, sex work, and gender parity.

        "text": "Art by CalliopePavlides He waited at the end of her block, like he used to when waiting for her parents car to leave the driveway or for her to step recklessly down from the roof and start across the lawn toward him. It was always night then and the darkness hid him from sight. Now it was day, sultry and consumed with light, and he would have been fully visible if not for the bushes, planted and overgrown in the time shed been away.  Yes, she was coming back today. He had the day marked. It was the end of her first year away and her parents had gone to collect her and bring her home. It was true that, during the latter part of the year, they hadnt spoken much, not after winter break, not after that night down at the harbor next to the tepid ocean, surface like glass, covered in faintly falling snowflakes. Tears fell too that night and he remembered feeling them freeze and crack on his cheeks as he followed her up the steps, back into the car theyd left running. It was true too that he had not told her he would be waiting for her, nor had she asked, but he had to see her, having banished her from his life, which was just his phone. The town, which was always still, became somehow more stagnant once the school year began and all his friends fled to more exciting areas. He was taking classes online and once he had the money saved, he too would flee these streets, off into new adventures, but for now he explored through the cracked screen of his phone. He coveted blue oceans and orange mountains, gaggles of kids in matching sports gear gathered around tables of beer, old friends with new girlfriends, their arms around one another, smiling drunk and casual cool. Ofttimes he would take a beer or two from the fridge and after finishing them, and after reaching the point in his feed where there were no new pictures, only ads, he would take to the street and walk, hands tucked in his pockets, coat drawn up to his neck no matter the weather. He tried to think while walking, tried to ponder the big questions that the boys at her school no doubt pondered, no doubt formulated opinions on, but he was left only with a hollow sort of longing that he could not quantify or express. It was that longing that brought him here, the end of her street, hiding behind the bushes. He believed seeing would satisfy that longing, or at least quell it enough that he could find himself able to ponder those big thingslife, death, the universe. At last, he saw her parents Honda, an ugly ochre hue, and he crouched, sweat-drenched, behind the wild bushes, peering through the tangle of leaves and limbs. Her father, whod gone gray in the interim year, got out first, then her mother, who kept her hair young. Then she got out of the back seat, a long muscular leg extending, poised on the driveways asphalt in waiting, as if she knew he was watching, as if she wanted to goad him. Then the rest of her came, looking tired and unconcerned, and just as beautiful. Her hair was long, near her waist, and shed leaned into her natural color, having let it go raven black. From the end of the block, through the thicket, he could see she wore no makeup and he had believed he was the only one with the privilege to see her like that. He was wrong.  They collected bags and went inside, then he returned to his aged Mercury Tracer and drove home. Hed made a resolve not to call her, not to text, so as not to give up any power he hoped he still had. Their mutual friends were all coming home and soon there would be parties and gatherings and beer and maybe then hed talk to her, making up lies about what hed been up to, places hed gone on the weekends, mischief hed gotten into. Hed leave out the trash can full of wadded up tissues, the nights staring at the TV so intently, so mindlessly, that hed failed to realize hed been watching an infomercial for an hour. He would try to guide her from sharing her own stories, knowing he was not strong enough to hear them, that his face would contort and crumble, and he couldnt bear her recognizing that and apologizing.  So he waited.  Calliope Pavlides,    Colored pencil, wax pastel, dry pigment on paper 28 x 22 inches They lit up the marquee outside the old theater as they always did for the summer. The boats in the harbor were cleaned and their bells clanged in chorus with one another. The football team began practices. Bonfires, sporadic and quiet, were lit and extinguished. At the summer camp, the green team won color wars. Pools, begged for by children, lay open but unused, inflated rafts moving listlessly with the wind. Lawns were mowed. Weeds were trimmed. And the harmonious din of childrens screams of freedom slowly diminished as the summer carried on and the signs for back-to-school sales were hung in the windows of the shops on Main Street.  He got a job at the local liquor store, another job renting kayaks to the few tourists and summering city couples. The liquor store afforded him time in the coolers, reprieve from the heat. It also afforded him discounts for beer he was too young to buy but was allowed to, so long as the manager wasnt in. The kayaks and the tourist had a more demanding manager who watched him obsessively from the offices that overlooked the shed housing the kayaks. Throughout the day, the sun reflected off the windows of the office, rendering the building a bougie panopticon, and even when he was sure his manager wasnt watching, the slightest mistake was accompanied by the rending open of that office door, the manager's footfalls on the wooden steps, the managers voice paternally calling his name.  Thered been no parties, no adventures. The friends he did see, the ones not away on study-abroads or visiting college friends from different states, only sipped cheap beer and complained of boredom, unaware of how much it stung him that he could not commiserate. The indolent Friday nights of that summer were the most fun hed had in a year.  And he had not heard from her, though there were a few nights he drafted texts, some feigning nonchalance, others professing all his regrets and his evergreen feelings, but he deleted them all. It wasnt until the final week of that summer that he reached out to her. They should meet up, he said, get something to eat or drink. She replied, quickly, with a yes and added that she missed him. He missed her too.  Calliope Pavlides,  , 2021  Pastel on paper 28 x 22 inches Barbarys on the Coast, a small, ancient restaurant whose name was no longer humorous to locals, rested above the harbor and, from its rear windows, gave a pleasant view of the now idle boats below, the gently rippling waves, and the Horner lighthouse a half mile out into the bay. The lighthouse was a turgid brick square sitting hideously amidst the calm waters of the bay and populated, as local legend has it, only by ghosts since the automatic lighting system had been installed. The iron bars on the windows had tarnished with sea rust and the fence keeping out rebellious sailors was halfway lost to the waters at its base. There was no need for upkeep, as no one, save the technicians who checked wiring quarterly, ventured out there anymore. The lighthouse was located where the waters of the Kennikee River mingled angrily with the cool current of the Atlantic, and though the surface looked calm, it was known to push and pull and exhaust anyone without the aid of wind or a motor. Teens knew there were easier, less risky, places to get drunk, and the few that did venture out in search of ghosts only came back with tall tales that they themselves could not finish without laughing.  He was looking out over the bay from the Barbarys back windows, at the stunted lighthouse silhouetted by the setting sun, pondering the stories that surrounded it, when she came through the door. He had a moment to watch her while she searched the restaurant for him, a moment to linger on the hope that this meeting would not be as halfhearted as all the other meetings with friends had been, that maybe some of that distant, and possibly imagined, electricity between them would reignite. She noticed him, smiled, and came over. He stood to hug her and after they parted, they each took a seat on opposite sides of the booth.  How are you? she said with a new, energetic slant. Gone was her perpetual boredom, the ever-present listlessness that pervaded the voices in that town.  Im good. Good. Your hair is  looks cool, he said, fiddling with a napkin. Really? Thanks. My roommate convinced me to do it. I was against it at first but now I really like it. I think it suits me, she smiled and flipped her hair with flourish. What else had her roommate convinced her to do? It definitely does, he said. So what about you? How have you been? Oh, you know, working. Im glad you called. I thought I was going to have to go the whole summer without seeing you. Phone works two ways, you know? he said in the old, teasing tone, and expected her to smile. She didnt.  I didnt know if you wanted to see me  after everything. Ill always want to see you, he said. There was a quick flutter of her old smitten eyes. The ones that looked up at him during their taciturn evenings alone, the nights he thought about when lying in his bed with the windows open, thick summer air and bugs falling through the screen.  Im glad, she said, flutter gone.  Calliope Pavlides,  , 2021  Soft pastel and colored pencil on paper 28 x 22 inches The waiter took their orders. He ordered a water and she a Coke and he thought about the drastic changes college had brought. She never drank soda, never had dark hair. After the waiter brought over their drinks and turned away, she dug in her purse (and now she was carrying a purse!) and drew out a flask. She peered around the empty restaurant, a look of sly subterfuge on her face, and poured a bit of the flasks contents into her glass. Want some? she asked, returning the flask to her lap. What is it? I only got water so  Its gin so no one can tell, she said, knocking the metal flask against his knees under the table.  He took it, poured some in his water, and returned it. He drank. Plain water and gin tasted awful. He gagged and she laughed and her laugh was the first thing that evening that didnt seem stricken by something unsaid between them. It seemed to leave behind the tears and his pitiful begging and the mean things hed said drunk and allowed them to return not to what they were before, but rather a time before even that, when they did not know each other and there was no history between them at all. He figured that was as good as anything else. So they drank and laughed and picked at potstickers and she regaled him with stories of collegedormitories, parties, classes, and clubsand he listened and pretended she was a stranger. He interjected only briefly, having only a few stories of his own about spills at the liquor store or the town-rupturing tale of Mayor Lutigs affair with a town councilwoman. Maybe it was the alcohol or maybe it was just out of necessity, either way he allowed himself to sink into her presence and remain there, suspended, thinking neither of the past nor the future, but only the little moment of now, the first time in a year hed felt entertained.  Night descended and the beam of the lighthouse swept across the harbor, the rear of Barbarys, their gin-filled glasses, and their reddening faces. They got kicked out, gently, by their waiter who informed them summer hours were over and Barbarys was closing. They exited the front door and, realizing they were in no state to drive, descended to the harbor, talking still amongst the sounds of the docked boats.  I always liked it here, she said, pausing and looking out toward the lighthouse.  He wanted to add that he liked it too but still he recalled their final night and all hed said through childlike, blubbering lips. No, for him the harbor now held only shame and heartbreak and no amount of gin and musing would change that.  Id like to get a picture, she said.  Oh yeah? Kids at school, theyre all  city kids, Id guess youd say? Theyre amazed when I tell them stories about this place. Why? They say its so quaint, so picturesque, she turned from the bay to him, yes, those are the words they use. They say it sounds like a movie or a book. It doesnt sound real. I want to show them. Show them where Im from. Well, he said, not quite understanding, and gestured toward the bay, Take a picture. No. I want to take it from the lighthouse. There again was that devilishness, the mischievousness. Yes, it was that haunting, sibilant tone that hed forgotten and that reminded him it was still her in there. That lurid hissing that made him sneak out all those nights, made him skinny dip and run naked back to his car, made him try the acid shed gotten from her cousin. And to the soundtrack of her giddy, drunken laughter, they descended the embankment to the shed that stored the rental kayaks, the shed he had the key to. The two of them pushed the kayak into the shallows and climbed aboard. In tandem they paddled until the lights of the harbor, the sound of the docked boats, faded behind them.  Calliope Pavlides,  , 2022  50 cm x 65.5cm / 19.6 in x 25.7in  Soft Pastel, oil pastel, wax crayon and colored pencil The lighthouse beam illuminated the small crests in the water and some waves lapped over the side, soaking his pants. The water was cold, despite the time of year. She took breaks from paddling to take pictures. Pictures of the lights growing smaller. Picture of the lighthouse growing larger. Pictures of herself with him smiling over her shoulder. She paused also to take swigs from her flask and offer it to him behind her back. Sometimes he took it, sometimes he did not.  His arms and back began to burn with strain. The demands of high school sports had kept him in shape and hed not realized just how much the static nature of his new life had dwindled his muscles, ruined his endurance. By the time the bow of the kayak crashed against the rocks at the base of the lighthouse, he was panting. She got out first and helped him afterward. Panting still, he pulled the kayak further onto the rocks and tied it to a piece of fence that was not yet molted by rust. They scrambled up the rocks to the base of the lighthouse.  She looked around in wonderment and the light of the lighthouse shone through her new black hair and he watched her raise her phone and take pictures of the small line of lights that outlined the shore. It was quiet. Just the crash of small waves against the rocks. He regained his breath and was finally able to stand straight.  Come on, she said, already starting toward the lighthouse. He followed, dutifully.  The old iron door was chained, as it always was, but, as always, the flaccid chain allowed the door to be opened wide enough for someone to slide through. And they did. She turned on her phone light. He drew his phone from his wet pants, soaked with seawater, and found it dead.  Fuck, he said, mutedly. What? I think my phone is fucked. Shit, really? He held the volume and lock button. The screen remained black. Yeah. Im sorry. He was able to recognize the sinking feeling in his stomach, the dread of just how much a new phone would cost, but the true misery of the realization was unable to break through the gin.  Its fine, he said. They followed the silver light of her phone up the metal stairs. Through gap-toothed windows and portholes of failing brick he heard the sound of the bay, water slapping the graffitied stones, rattling the derelict fence. She paused once on the stairs to take a photo of him. The light blinded him. When she showed him the photo, he was squirting and ghost white against a background as black as the void.  Thats a keeper, she said, smiling at the photo. Calliope Pavlides,  , 2021  Colored pencil and dried pigment on paper 28 x 22 inches They continued up the stairs until they reached the door to the gallery. She pushed it open and light filled the vacant shaft they had just climbed and illuminated the cobwebs, glass bottles, and discarded cigarettes that carpeted the ground. She hung her head over the railing and said, It looked better without the light. Then she stepped out onto the galley. They sat there on the edge, legs dangling, the shadows across their faces ebbing and flowing with the rotating light. They traded swigs of the dwindling gin. To their left were the lights of the harbor, of the town, of their childhood homes, and to the right that endless darkness of the sea. The night dark that caused the ocean and the sky to meld impenetrability and where there should have been stars or the moon or even the reflection of those, there was only uniform and unknowable darkness.  I miss you, he said, looking out into that featureless space.  I miss you too, she said earnestly. This has been the best night of my summer. Im sure thats not true. It has. Its the only night where something has happened. I havent done anything in  months. Well, summers are supposed to be lazy. It wasnt just the summer. It was the whole year. Everyones gone. Youre saving up, right? Youll be gone soon too. No, I wont, he said and looked back toward her. Over her shoulder rested all those lights he knew so well. Oh, stop. Of course you will.  He thought to argue or at least to explain. But he found himself unable to think of how to describe what he felt. The finality of it. The sensation of having always known he would never leave, that there was nowhere to go for him, that the confines of the town were all he was supposed to know. And how to explain that even though hed always known, the realization, the admittance, the acceptance, had been paralyzingly painful and supremely shameful. All the things hed said hed do, all the things he was supposed to leave behind, were now lists of things he would never do, things he was perpetually bound to. And there was no one to explain this to, no one to sympathize, to commiserate. He was alone in those familiar lights while everyone hed ever known was lost in exploration of that vast, unknowable darkness. Even her. With her new hair, manicured nails, and constant photo-taking, it became clear that she was not the girl he had once known. Gone were the tomboyish jeans, the flippancy of Oh, I just left my phone at home, the fingernails embedded with dirt.  This at once crushed him and freed him. She was gone, and the pain of that would remain. But it lifted the weight of failure from his shoulders. He had not lost her. She just was no more. Youre right, he said and gave her a small laugh. Calliope Pavlides,  , 2021  Colored pencil and dried pigment on paper 28 x 22 inches They sat together until the gin was gone and until she said she was cold. They stood and she took one last photo of them together with the lights of the town behind them. Then they started down the stairs, lit again by her phone light. Midway down, it died, leaving them in darkness. They hardened their breaths. She whispered his name harshly. There was a pause where all that could be heard was the buzzing of the large bulb above them. Then they began to laugh. Snickering little bursts, like children up too late at a slumber party. Then the two of them howled. They fumbled down the stairs, gripping one another, gripping the rusted railing, bits of chipped paint and flaking metal pricking their fingers. They breathed warm gin breath into each others faces and mocked each others stench. The way down was long and perilous and he hoped that it would never end.  Eventually they emerged from the base of the lighthouse. The wind had picked up slightly and tossed her hair across her face.  Hey, she said. Hey, he said. Wheres the kayak? He looked down at the rocks where theyd docked the boat and found there only barnacles and a flailing rope.  Fuck. He glanced out across the water but, even with the light from the lighthouse, he could not make out the shape of the kayak. Only the steady pulse of the sea.  Fuck, he said again. Itll be okay, she said. No, no it wont. Boats will come by tomorrow. Theyll see us. We just have to, you know, spend the night, she giggled. Wish I had more gin though. I cant lose the kayak. My boss will kill me, he said, moving about the base of the lighthouse, looking out over the water again.\t Itll be okay, she said again. No, it fucking wont. Those things are expensive and Im not supposed to take them out outside of work hours.  Listen, she said, stepping to him. Itll be okay. Your boss will understand. Youll be able to pay him back. It might take some time but you will, okay? He hated her then and the fact that she was so calm. He hated that, rescued as they would be at dawn, she could just leave and forget. He hated too that she would codify this as an adventure, add it to a collection of crazy things shed done in her youth, a story to share with her college friends as they sat around drinking in some bar far more interesting than Barbarys. There was no fleeing for him. This story would only be one of shame and anger. He would have to explain to his manager the next day that hed lost the kayak. He would have to bear that patronizing, righteous tone from his manager as he explained the importance of responsibility, explained the disappointment he felt because he really trusted him as an employee. He would have to watch his paychecks be sucked away, still not covering the cost of the kayak. And his phone! All the money hed tallied up, saving for school, for the promise of escape, was eaten up in one night.  Calliope Pavlides,  , 2022  56cm x 76cm / 22in x 30in  Soft Pastel, oil pastel, wax crayon and colored pencil Are you okay? she asked him.  He opened his mouth to tell her no, to tell her she was callous, to tell her she didnt understand his situation. Who was she, anyway? Who was this pretend person with dyed hair, taking selfies, worried about impressing others? But over her shoulder, the neon green of the kayak caught the light and without answering he sprinted toward the rocks.  What are you doing? she yelled. He did not stop and stayed focused on the neon green spot that shone and faded with the passing light. At the edge of the rocks, he jumped, and even suspended in the air he made note of the kayak, its position, its slight drifting toward the darkness of the ocean beyond the bay. The water consumed him at once, dampening his clothes, weighing him down. It was colder than hed expected but manageable. He ruptured the surface and took a moment to get his bearings, locating both the kayak which bobbed before him and the lighthouse that sat behind him with her yelling at its base.  He kicked against the current which he found was working against him. He kicked against the weight of his shirt and pants. He lost a shoe while he kicked, even more money wasted. He kicked harder, putting his head down and thrashing against the waves that beat against him, waves that had seemed small from the kayak and from the shore, waves that now seemed mountainous. He kicked and sent his arms out far ahead of him, waiting, expecting, to feel the fiberglass of the kayaks body against his fingers. He kicked and beat and stroked until his muscles ached as they had before paddling out to the lighthouse. He paused to rest. The kayak was still just as far but the lighthouse had grown smaller, as did the soft sound of her screams, which were now faint as whispers. If they hadnt shared gin, he would have panicked. But, inebriated, he knew only his purpose of reaching the kayak. He started to kick again but his legs did not move. He tried to contract his arms but found them stuck in place. He thought he felt his second shoe slide from his foot but wasnt sure if that was just the loss of feeling. It was colder than hed expected. The kayak, caught for the last time in the light of the lighthouse, drifted further out toward the indistinguishable horizon. He did too. He drifted until he could no longer hear the tin cry of her voice, until he could no longer feel the prickling cold of the water, until he too became part of that vast darkness beyond the sea.

        "text": "Translation by Lisa Dillman and Daniel Hahn Art by Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad Excerpted from  , published by  Bellevue Literary Press .  Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,  , 2022  Acrylic on paper, 50x70 cm  My grandparents lived in a palace. To me, at least, it was a palace. They used to say that my Lebanese grandfather, on a long trip through Mexico in the mid-forties, had fallen in love with a house and then had its same Mexican architect come to Guatemala, with the same rolled-up blueprints under his arm, to build him the same house on some land hed recently purchased on Avenida Reforma. I dont know if the story is true. Probably not, or not so much. Doesnt really matter. Every house has its story, and every house, to someone, is a palace. I remember its smell. Each morning, a short, testy housekeeper named Araceli would work her way through the whole housethe huge foyer, the three living rooms, the two dining rooms and two studies, the billiard room, and the six bedrooms on the second floorcarrying a censer filled with eucalyptus leaves. My brother and I were afraid of this old woman, who was our height, had gray hair, wore a black uniform, and yelled a lot, and who always seemed to emerge like a ghost from a cloud of white smoke. Its impossible to forget the effect that that daily dose of eucalyptus had, over the course of decades, on the walls and the wood floors and the Persian rugs that my grandfather had brought from Beirut. But the house didnt smell only of eucalyptus. The aroma was far more complex, far more elegant, comprised also of all the fragrances and spices that emanated like souls from the kitchen. And the kitchen was the territory of Berta, the cook my Egyptian grandmother had stolen from a Guatemalan restaurant called El Gran Pavo, and whom shed later trained in the art of Arabic cuisine and the art of Israeli cuisine (while surely there is one, I was lucky never to have known the difference). There they fried falafel and kibbe. They baked bagels, pita bread, sambouseks filled with cheese, with spinach, with eggplant. They made mujaddara (jaddara, my grandfather called it), an exquisite dish of rice and lentils served with fried onion and a yogurt, cucumber, and mint sauce. They made yapraks: grape leaves stuffed with rice, lamb, pine nuts, and tamarind. They prepared, on very special occasions, a Sephardic stew, boiled long and slow (twenty-four hours), called hamin. They made fresh yogurt, and various cheeses and jams. In the pantry there were always jars filled with anise pastries, trays of baklava diamonds, a few wooden barrels filled with the olives (black, purple, green) that my grandfather imported from Lebanon. But, in the kitchen, Berta also returned to her Guatemalan roots, and made shredded beef hilachas and chicken jocn and tamales and pepin and kakik and a miraculously thick corn atol. And there, too, every night, in a small copper pot, she made my grandfather his Turkish coffee with toasted cardamom seeds, since he needed a cup of Turkish coffee to get to sleep. My grandfather sat at the head of the dining room table, the copper pot in his hand, pinkie slightly raised (his three-carat diamond ring twinkling), serving everyone a small cup of Turkish coffee, whether they wanted it or not. He took loud, crude slurps. He shouted if it wasnt boiling hot. At my grandparents house, Turkish coffee was much more than coffee: it was a rite, a cadence, a spell, an end point to things both sweet and bitter, the last of which coincided with a visit from an Argentine cousin named Berenice. Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,  , 2022  Acrylic on canvas, 50x70 cm This is your cousin Berenice. I was kneeling on the Persian rug in the foyer, stacking my grandmothers poker chips into towers. Right above me sparkled the enormous candelabra, which I always thought was made of diamonds and which required a complicated system of cranks and pulleys to be cleaned. It was nighttime. I was embarrassed to be in my pajamas and slippers. Come now, children, say hello, someone said, and they left us alone together. I stacked another chip. The red tower collapsed. All the same color? Berenice sat down in front of me. In her mouth, a black hole in place of two or three incisors. She had the blondest hair Id ever seenit was almost silver. She wore an airy pink dress. Her knees were all scratched up. I said do the towers have to be all the same color? I dont know, I managed to stammer. Hierarchy was quickly established. I had yet to lose a single tooth. Better if you mix the colors, she said. The adults were drinking and chatting in the living room as wheezing and snoring from the second floor seemed to rain down upon us. Whats that?, she asked, forehead creased, eyes cast upward. That, I said, is Nono. Berenice had come from Buenos Aires with her parents to visit Nono. That was what we called him, Nono, the husband of one of my grandmothers sisters, an old man with white hair and slow, kindly gestures. I remember four things about him. One: he was a faithful devotee of cowboy movies. Two: he was born in Salonica, Greece, and whenever someone sneezed, he would say in his native Ladino, Bivas, kreskas, engrandeskas, komo un peshiko en aguas freskas, amen. Which was something like: Youre born, you grow, you thrive, you dream, like a fishie in the stream. Three: he had fled Paris with one of my grandmothers sisters just after their wedding, a few days before the German occupation, leaving the apartment theyd bought on Rue de Vaugirard furnished but unlived in. And four: one day he just showed up prostrate on a white cot in the second-floor hallway at my grandparents house. I never understood why this old man moved to my grandparents house, or why they put him there, out in the hallway, and not in one of the six unoccupied bedrooms. But suddenly there he was: very ill, gaunt, always accompanied by a nurse and always in a white gown, muttering incoherently and lying faceup on the cot theyd placed at the end of the second-floor hallwayin front of three big picture windowsthat circled the entire second floor and had an iron railing that overlooked the enormous foyer at the entrance. That was when relatives started coming from other countries to visit him. And that was when Nonos wheezing and snoring began to thunder through the house like a perpetual storm. Better like this, she whispered. Berenices long fingers continued to dismantle my blue, black, and yellow towers and then form new ones, calmly, skillfully, combining the poker chips. She was focused. From within the black hole of her smile poked a little tip of tongue. Whatre you looking at? Nothing. Oh, nothing, sure. Im not, Im not looking at anything. Youre looking at something. I kept quiet and Berenice kept stacking chips, slowly, carefully. Later, she said, Ill show you my tushie. Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,  , 2021  Acrylic on canvas, 50x50 cm  The stairs at my grandparents house were magnificent. Go up two, she said, then down one. Like this. A burgundy-colored rug led up the stairs to a sort of landing. Now, she said, stay there. I obeyed and stopped on the landing, where the stairs bifurcated and you had to decide whether to climb the rest of the way up on the left or the right, that is, to the three bedrooms on the left or the three bedrooms on the right (though there was just one wide hallway, which circled the entire second floor). Now, she said, get under there. On the landing, there was a cedar side table with fresh-cut roses and a set of bronze scales and framed photosin case, I imagined, you had trouble deciding whether to keep going on the right or on the left and wanted to just land there for a bit first, on the landing. Boy, are they ugly, she said, looking up. Above the small cedar table, high on the wall, hung a grandiose wrought-iron relief of two whinnying horses, a design my grandfather had copied from a highball glass. Ill hide here, she said, with you. We didnt fit under the cedar table. When I count to three, Berenice said, you run up the right and Ill run up the left and whoever gets there first and touches Nono wins. Ready? She counted to three. I let her win. You couldnt pay me to touch Nono. Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,  , 2022  Acrylic on canvas, 120x90 cm Us kids were having dinner at the kids table, in the pantry, and the adults in the dining room, just beside it. From time to time, Berta would come in from the kitchen with a tray of just-fried kibbe, with more lemon wedges, with more tahini, with another pitcher of horchata or cinnamon water. Berenice had moved my brother from his spot so she could sit next to me, and spent the whole time talking about her girlfriends in Buenos Aires, her apartment in Buenos Aires, her two cats in Buenos Aires. When dessert was served, my father poked his head into the pantry and announced that we should come into the dining room, quick, because Uncle Salomn was about to read the Turkish coffee. Read the what?, Berenice asked, grabbing my forearm tightly as all the cousins pushed back their chairs and ran off screaming. The Turkish coffee, I told her. How do you read that? Berenice was still sitting there, still holding on to my forearm. I explained that first someone drank a small cup of Turkish coffee, and then Uncle Salomn took the small cup and sat looking at the grounds at the bottom and told the person about their future. No way, she said, letting go of my arm. Its true. Berenice opened her eyes wider. So has he read your coffee? It only works with grown-ups. I want him to read my coffee, she exclaimed. But youre not grown-up. Just about, she said defensively. Berenice was already on her feet and walking quickly toward the dining room and so I also raced off, more for her, of course, than for the spectacle of Uncle Salomn and the Turkish coffee. Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,  , 2022  Acrylic on canvas, 169x136 cm Uncle Salomn was not my uncle. He was one of my grandmothers cousins. But we all called him Uncle Salomn anyway. He was a tall, thin old man, balding, with a gruff voice, light blue eyes, and the face of a Bedouin. He was always impeccably dressed: jacket and tie and gold cuff links and loafers so shiny they looked new. He was the only person who regularly beat my grandfather at backgammon, on the huge mother-of-pearl and polished shell table that opened up and out like origami. He could conjure small coins from my ear and cigarettes from my nose. He introduced me to my first naked ladies, on playing cards he slipped me in secret. I dont know why, possibly out of a sense of balance or symmetry, I liked knowing that he and his brother had married two sisters. Have you drunk it all, my dear?, he asked. Berenices mother wiped her lips, made an apologetic face, and said yes, almost, all but the dregs. At the bottom of your cup, he told her, is one-sixtieth of the coffee. What do you mean, one-sixtieth?, she asked. Uncle Salomn squinted a bit and furrowed his brow and said that, according to rabbinical commentary on the Talmud, fire is one-sixtieth of hell, and honey is one-sixtieth of manna, and Shabbat is one-sixtieth of the world to come, and sleep is one-sixtieth of death, and dreams are one-sixtieth of prophecy. Right, she said. From her tone, it seemed to me that Berenices mother was unfamiliar with or maybe disdainful of Uncle Salomns manner of speech, both paradoxical and parabolical. Now, my dear, place the saucer on top of your cup, but turn it over, upside down. The dining room had filled with children and adults. Most of us stood close to Uncle Salomn. Good, he said. Now lift the cup and saucer and, slowly, carefully, spin the cup three times to the left. That is to say, counterclockwise. There was silence. Berenices mother, smiling nervously and counting out loud, spun the small cup three times, while Nono made his presence known from his cot on the second floor. Very good, Uncle Salomn said. Now, still taking care, still holding the cup in your right hand, place your left on top of the saucer. Thats right. And finally, in one quick move, I want you to turn the whole thing upside down. What do you mean, turn the whole thing upside down? The cup and saucer both? Thats right, both. So the cup is facedown on top of the saucer. Without dripping or spilling anything, do you understand? Yes, yes, she said, and managed to flip the small cup and saucer without spilling any. Somebody clapped. Were finished now, dear, you can leave it all on the table, Uncle Salomn whispered calmly, pulling a small white pack from inside his suede jacket. And now a cigarette, he said, while we wait for the coffee grounds to dry and settle and tell us something. Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,  , 2022  Acrylic on canvas, 168x158 cm Footsteps. That was the first thing. We heard their footsteps on the wood floor long before we saw them standing in the dining room doorway. Serious, mustachioed, in their tight khaki uniforms. The man of the house, one of the soldiers proclaimed: an order more than a question. I think none of us had heard the doorbell, or seen Araceli cross the dining room to the front door to let them in. My grandfather stood up. He walked toward them. I remember they did not greet one another, did not shake hands. The same soldier whod spoken turned and walked out of the dining room, with my grandfather trailing after him. Shortly thereafter we heard the creak of the study door closing. One of the soldiers followed Araceli to the kitchen, another two went to guard the foyer and front door, and two more remained where they were, staring at us in silence. My father tried to stand. Remain seated, seor, said one of them. I just wanted to see if they need anything in the study. You sit, do you hear me?, he said with one hand on his revolver. They dont need anything. Someone was outside, on the back lawn. I turned to the picture window overlooking the garden (my grandfathers favorite place to go for a secret smoke), and in the darkness saw an even darker shadow holding a dark rifle. Would you like anything to drink, officers? Some coffee?, my grandmother asked demurely, maybe just to break the silence, but neither one replied. Suddenly somebody threw something or broke something in the kitchen. We heard strange shouting coming from the study. We heard banging and wheezing and snoring on the second floor. Whats that? I didnt know at what point Berenice had grabbed my hand. Its a nurse, upstairs, taking care of my husband, said Nonos wife, with a slight tremor to her voice. The soldier, looking up at the second-floor hallway, lit a cigarette. I hope thats what it is, seora, and not something else, he said all smokily. Ill go check, she whispered. You will not go anywhere, seora, the man spat, then whispered something to the other soldier, who sped out of the dining room and up the stairs, and I pictured him on the landing, looking at the photos and the fresh-cut flowers and the two wrought-iron horses. The first soldier stood there, pawing the bronze mezuzah nailed to the doorframe. One of my aunts told him it was a Jewish talisman, that it was called a mezuzah, that it contained a scroll of parchment with verses from the Torah, that people put them there, on the doorframes of their homes, to bring good luck. The soldier went on struggling with it, banging it with his fist, as though he wanted to remove it from the doorframe and take it with him so that he, too, could have good luck. Yasmeen Abdullah Ahmad,    Acrylic on canvas, 50x50 cm Nobody said a word. Nobody moved. The adults were attempting to calm the children, stroking them and whispering to them, while also attempting to determine what was going on, what so many soldiers wanted with my grandfather, whose were the strident, intrusive voices we now heard coming from all over the house. Some from the huge foyer. Others, more muted, from the study. Others mixed in with wheezing from the stairs and second floor. Others from the kitchen or the backyard. I remember thinking that I wanted to be deaf. I wanted to put my fingers in my ears and be deaf and so not have to hear those voices that I, in a very childlike way, understood were not entirely good, were out of place, did not belong to my world of eucalyptus and baklava and colored poker chips. Suddenly my grandparents enormous house was too small. I let go of Berenices hand. Look, she whispered, elbowing me. Uncle Salomn was reading the coffee. At some point, Uncle Salomn had leaned over the table and taken the coffee cup and the saucer and was now studying the various shapes and shadows in the dried grounds. We all just watched him in silence (except for the soldier, who was still smoking in the dining room doorway and had no idea what Uncle Salomn was doing). We watched him maneuver the cup and rotate the saucer and raise his eyebrows and shake his head and sigh gently and even half smile. And we all half smiled as well, or tried to half smile, or at least calmed down a bit. But Uncle Salomn didnt say a thing. He never said a thing. He was never willing to say what he read in those grounds, or to say why he never again agreed to read another cup of Turkish coffee. Some of the family thought hed seen Nonos impending death. Others, that hed seen Berenice and her parents hasty return to Buenos Aires. Others, that hed seen the reflection of the present, of that moment, of all those soldiers prowling through the house like wild beasts while one of themI would learn decades later was in the study, informing my grandfather of the final whereabouts of one of the men who had kidnapped him in January of 1967. But we never found out: Uncle Salomn never said a thing. He simply finished reading that last Turkish coffee and placed the small cup and saucer on the table and lit another cigarette as though nothing had happened, half smiling, half smoking, half smirking at something with the whole of his Bedouin face.

        "text": "With one month left until Nowruz, Baran fills a few plates and a large crystal wheat dish for the Haft-Sin table. She arranges them all in a row by her living room window. In April 2017, Baran left Iran for the last time. Nowruz 2023 will be the sixth Eid that she celebrates in exile. She still does not know whether Nowruz 2024 will be in Turkey or a third country where she can build her permanent home. Two months before Nowruz 2021, I met Baran. At that time, I had fled Iran for several months and was living in Istanbul on a one-year tourist visa; while waiting for the outcome of the court that was going on in Iran. I was spending my days with photography or in the quarantine of Covid-19 at home. Baran was introduced to me by a mutual friend. She and her roommates lived in a three-bedroom apartment, which was like a piece of Iran to me. I remember the smell of saffron and Iranian rice at the entrance of the building. Whenever I would go to their apartment, it was the warm embrace of Baran, great Iranian homemade food, and nights of gathering with friends and laughing at the pains of the days that passed. I spent my first Nowruz in exile on the 2021 Nowruz at Barans house. The phones rang just a few minutes after the Iranian new year started. Baran was swallowing her tears as she chatted with her sister Pegah; I was shedding my tears in Barans arms when my conversation with my family was over. Shortly after, Baran switched on the TV, and the sound of Googoosh, an old Iranian pop singer, filled the living room, and everybody danced with tears and laughter. They taught me the power of laughter through the painthe ability to bear problems with the power of dance and hope. Baran has big dreams in her fourth decade of life. She is an Iranian refugee trans woman who studied political science before fleeing Iran. Baran, like most Iranian trans women, could not live her true gender identity freely due to social, legal, and Islamic problems. The police arrested her for wearing womens clothes. So she spent a horrible night in mens police custody. According to the laws of the Islamic Republic, trans people are recognized with their true identity only when they go through the legal process of gender reassignment and submit to forced surgeries. According to Islamic laws governing the country of Iran, which are different from international laws, trans people are considered mentally ill. If they appear in society with a male ID card and female clothes, the police can arrest and imprison them on fraud charges. These bitter experiences made Baran hide her identity for many years and finally seek refuge in Turkey. Turkey never gives passports to Iranian refugees but allows them to stay in predetermined cities when they go to a third country. This temporary stay may last for several years, and refugees never know when the exact time to settle in a third country will be. For this reason, they cannot plan for their future. After going to a third country, we Iranian refugees face the challenges of a new language, culture, laws, and customs in our residence. Baran has lived for six years in such a situation that I call the limbo of uncertainty. She is waiting for her visa and flight ticket to the United States, but she still plants her Nouruzs greens, each for a friend who lives in the same town as her, just like the yearly habit of her mother. Baran lost her mother due to illness a few years ago. Every year, she lights a candle next to the Haft-Sin table in memory of her mother. In which country will this table decorate Barans house next year? Masi Abolhassan is an Iranian freelance journalist, photographer, and a gender equality activist. She has always been interested in showing the difficulties vulnerable groups of people face in countries with limited or no democracy, such as basic human rights for women and LGBTQ groups. Her ongoing documentary series addressed Iranian transgender refugees in Turkey from 2020. ",

        "text": "Identity for a third culture kid, like myself, is bewildering. The impacts of the 1979 Iranian Revolution and its hijacked efforts that turned the country into an oppressive Islamic Republic have been felt for generations, affecting every Iranian I know. Unpacking the impacts requires distance and consciousness, things that can be a luxury and privilege. In an effort to understand how I've gone through this world, I've found great momentary clarity in looking at identity through a magnifying glass, in whatever abstract way my intuition leads me in. So I listen to myself, and feel through my work. These stills are from a video series I created 5 years ago. They resonate today the same way they resonated then. And that's the beauty, right? We have found community through storytelling, collaborating, writing, image making... any kind of expression or creative pursuit that touches on the experience of being in the middle, forever. I have realized we are all part of this process and our feelings are shared, paramount, and there since the beginning. It was just a matter of time that we connected the dots in this vast and always evolving effort. This Chapter series, in collaboration with musical artist Rahill Jamalifard, is an exploration of music, sound, and moving images, spanning three chapters through a poem ( chapter 1 ), a song ( chapter 2 ), and a mix ( chapter 3 ). Through each chapter we have been able to probe and gain more understanding of the symmetries of our relationship with family, culture and identity by way of our specific creative language. It allows us to see so much of ourselves and our experiences in each-other, as well as the Diaspora at large. Sunny Sanaz Shokrae is an Iranian born, American raised photographer and artist based in NYC.

        "text": "Fariba Hajamadi,  , 2021.  Ink on bridal satin. 54\" x 74\" overall, work in 2 parts Im always searching to recover what is lost, to rebuild my lost home. In many of the architectonic rooms I reconstruct, I close up the original space to create a window into a private space with no egress. This is a reflection of the classic Islamic architecture of the  , which has a specific meaning for the role of womento be invisible and have no way out. I choose images that look culturally familiar to me, and as a woman of Iranian origin this can be a fabric pattern, a carpet, or simply an image that serves as a metaphor for the female gaze. Symmetry and mirroring are important design elements in Islamic art and architecture, and they crop up in the way I put images together and in my reconstructions of these rooms. My use of these elements is a nod to the self-referential nature of Islamic design, where repetition and mirroring of a single element creates every whole. My work invites the viewer to inhabit these spaces as a way to reimagine  .  The images I work with are layered and fused together to create a seamless composite, often printed on fabric, canvas, or wood panel. This fusion of image and support produces a forceful hybrid that conflates two modes of production tradition, photography and painting. They are eventually presented as layered installations with wallpapers or in slide and video projections, but the process begins with transferring my photographs to canvas or wood panels, where I paint over and into them with oil paint. In the mid-80s, I mastered a darkroom technique where I brushed gel on large canvases or wood panels to render them photosensitive. I then processed them in the darkroom and painted on them. In the late 90s and early aughts, computers and digital imaging replaced the darkroom, offering limitless editing possibilities. As a result, my work took on a new dimension. After much experimentation I developed a technique to treat (by hand, in the studio) fabric, canvas, or wood to make these materials ink-receptive. I now use a large format printer to print directly on the substrate before I stretch it to paint.  Fariba Hajamadi,  , 2020. Ink on bridal satin. 54 x 74 overall, work in 2 panels This entire process always begins with the photographs I take of historical monuments and cultural artifacts in institutional settings. These are structures where violence and plunder predominate, where fact and fiction are conflated, and where women and non-Western identities have historically been alienated. This is like drawing a place that you have been to from memory. Each individual photo is a memory fragment. Each representation develops through a process of transformation and manipulation in documenting, photographing, and archiving. This speaks to the fact that at any point in these processes, representation can easily become misrepresentation. The final works appear to be seamless, but each piece is made up of many fragments pieced together. This layering of the past and the present coincides with my profound sense of existing at once inside and outside cultural norms. My work is a space where these contradictory conditions may coexist as I seek to reimagine  .  Fariba Hajamadi  (b. Esfahan, Iran) lives and works in Los Angeles and Brooklyn. She received her BFA in painting from Western Michigan University and MFA from Calarts where she studied with John Baldessari. Her fellow students included Ashley Bickerton, Christopher Williams, Kate Ericson, Larry Johnson, Mel Ziegler, and Bill Wurtz. Since 1982 Hajamadi has made work that investigates displacement, loss, trauma, tragedy, war, culture and gender identity in large scale pieces using photo emulsion on canvas and painting on fabric, canvas, and wood panels. She often presents these works to generate new narrative possibilities by examining cultural appropriation and construction of the occidental narrative of the oriental Other through the lens of a woman born in a non-Western culture. Hajamadis work has been exhibited in the United States and internationally including solo exhibitions at Christine Burgin Gallery, Max Protetch Gallery, Queens Museum (all in NY); Galerie Laage-Salomon, Paris; Fonds Rgionale dArt Contemporain De Basse-Normandie; Muse Municipal de La Roche-sur-Yon; Ecole Rgionale dArt de Dunkerque; Rhona Hoffman Gallery, Chicago; Maureen Paley, London; and the I.C.A., Philadelphia.

        "author": "Niloufar Talebi",
        "text": "Preface and excerpt from  , 2023 I just erased 1,500 words I had carefully written in October 2022 when the new Iranian uprising was fresh. The piece was to act as a preface to the following excerpt of  , which is about me claiming my desires and unbelonging, pushing back against the institutions that make an industry of inquisitions from immigrants, refugees, and exiles. The West invades and displaces us, deigns to maybe allow us in through their borders, then examines and fetishizes our estrangement. The cycle is endlessly propagandized and monetized, a perfect closed circuit. The Empire depends on our otherness. I had aimed to contextualize current events in Iran, since youll be reading about Iran here. This albatross to explain Iran. Why couldnt I be from a country that isnt constantly politicized? Youll be reading about my homeland that burns, my homeland that I have not been to in thirty-nine years but hold on to, a wound that doesnt heal, a homeland that we are prodded about by our Western hosts. Where is home for you, what is home to you? they keep asking in precious hushed tones at swanky events with mucho publicity. They mean the home that has been dismantled over and over again from within and without. Lording it over us that we are somehow a temporary tenant in their home.  Five months after writing those words, upon publication of this excerpt, I found the preface outdated. In fact, it never reflected my uncertainty about the events. That I can't be sure of how they figure into the larger geopolitical chess game of oligarchs and psychopaths. That I dont trust news from the seemingly pro-uprising, antiIslamic Republic platforms whose funding sources are questionable. That I cant be sure of the machinations at work behind the scenes in the gridlock of Russia, Ukraine, Iran, China, the US, Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and parts of Africa. I refuse to buy into the edited masquerade of Iran, a collage of snuck-out videos, strategically distributed pieces, viral distractions, misinformation, disinformation, self-promotions of so-called leaders in the diaspora, and the inactions of Western watchdogs and regulatory bodiesthough there is some attempt at pretense and posturingall bundled up to give us a Total Fiction, a   of sorts. The first layer of reports is that Mahsa Zhina Amini was arrested in September 2022 by the Islamic states morality police while visiting Tehran from her native Kordestan region of Iran. Twenty-two-year-old Mahsa died in their custody while in a coma from a brain hemorrhage likely caused by repeated blows to her head, possibly while she was shoved into a van because her hejab wasnt deemed pious enough at that hour on that day on that street. Two journalists, Niloofar Hamedi and Elahe Mohammadi, broke the story, documenting her hospitalization and funeralhow we know about her case, though this is a perpetual state of terror in Iran. The journalists have been detained in Evin prison and charged with being foreign agents of the United States.  This became a watershed moment spurring protests on September 17, 2022, the day after Mahsa died, now the longest sustained all-over demonstrations in the forty-four-year history of the Islamic Republic.  Out has poured cumulated rage against not only the brutalities of the Islamic Republic, but against the legacies of global patriarchy and greed to fuel a new vindication of the rights not only of women but of every soul suffering the twenty-first century: the control of womens bodies, the obscene wealth gap of late-stage capitalism, climate disasters, homelessness, chronic hopelessness, the damages of social media, the decline of culture in favor of technocracy, corruption, inflation, crushing sanctions, public revelations of harassment that led to the #MeToo movement, the murder of George Floyd in plain view, and so much more.  Young Iranians are unleashing our common pain, their bound hairs, burning their headscarves to make effigies of them, and raising their middle fingers to dictators. Those old figureheads whose terror of women has led to whole ideologies to crush us. No more they say. Schoolgirls stomp on their images and scream their name back at them  (pronounced like bee, meaning without) and   (honor). Honorless to the power of Motherfucker. Say it. Say their name:  The Islamic state has waged war on protestors. Teenagers have been savagely beaten by paramilitary groups, tortured, murdered. Nika, Sarina, Siavash, Zakariah, and countless unnamed Gen-Z guerillas. Thousands are arrested. Innocents have been hanged after sham trials. We are collectively exhausted from the tactical wrangling of our emotions.  The uprising has been fruitful on several levels. Iranian people have shown a new brand of courage to the world. Theyve upped the stakes, inspired youyes you, readerto stand up for yourself, pushed us, the diaspora, to air our private painbe it openly mourning a homeland in ruin or reporting the micro- and macroaggressions carried out on us by White Institutions we strive to belong to. Schoolgirls and young women have imagined new frontiers for us, these Joan-of-Arcs, these bludgeoned beacons who rise to the pantheon of pantheons. But there are layers we cannot even begin to decipher. Deceptions behind deceptions. My hope for change in Iran is laced with the anxiety of the fugue of historybloodshed to blank slate to another Big Brother to bloodshed.  I vacillate between wanting global support, but recoil when Western power brokersthe Clintons, the Bidensexpress support of the Iranian people. All I can think of is their changing stories and agendas.  The announcement by Jill Biden, the first lady of the United States, of Iranian composer Shervin Hajipours 2023 Grammy win for   in the first-ever Best Song for Social Change Special Merit Award category, read as political theater. I cant even fully enjoy his win. On the one hand, why shouldnt Hajipour win? He composed   (which means For or Because of, widely translated as For Freedom) from tweets by Iranian people expressing their frustrations and hopes for the uprisings. The song went viral and has become an anthem of the revolution. And we united to rally for his win. On the other hand, it is political that the Islamic regime arrested Hajipour and made him remove  \" from his social media, and later released and charged him with inciting violence, causing him to lie low. I cringe at the win being celebrated as validation from the West. The Iranian writer Jalal Al-Ahmad wrote a book on this, Gharbzadegi, often translated as Westoxification. Hajipour posted two words just after the win on his social media: We won. He later released a statement that read (in my translation): All of the people of Iran and I celebrate this win, but it must be said that the lives and wellbeing of many Iranians and the region itself have been destroyed by a government whose first lady presented me with this award. Instead, I wish an award for a work of art was presented by an artist. I love my beloved country in all its beauty and I shall remain here. Whether this was coerced by the Islamic regime or it was self-prompted, it reflects the knotted ball of complexities we face. I hope that one day my homeland can vindicate itself. I have also come to realize that time has marched on and I am somehow Irans past, conflicted even about calling her my homeland. I am her lost generation. And her future belongs to the generation that teaches me about a place that is no longer mine. The generation that is burning down the house and is burning for it.  This is for all who have skeletons in their own closets but pry about my home:  The scraggly guy who enters the ATM lobby after me and waits on a bench tells me its a Georgian thing that the young woman in a crop top and high-waisted white jeans stands at my back talking loudly on her phone and looking over my shoulder as Im trying to transact.  She doesnt budge despite me turning around to mime you are crowding me, please step back. She was in the same position with the man at the ATM before me, so I thought they were together and I was confused when she didnt leave with him. I spread my body to crowd her back and turn to tell the guy that Ive been coming to this lobby for a few months and nothing like this Georgian thing has happened. But that it would make sense: a doctor I saw at the clinic in Tbilisi told me to undress and just stood there with her nurse glaring at me arms crossed and grinning. In the US, they leave the room, give you time and a paper vest, then knock before entering. He asks where Im from. I say isnt it obvious since Ive just demanded space. In English no less. He says no. I say Im from America. He says he wants to go there one day. Its usual for me to hear this abroad. Everybody is USA USA WOW California! I want to say its not what you think it is, but I dont. You should go! Are you Georgian? No, Im Ukrainian.  Oh shit. I should have known from his slouch. Here in Georgia thousands of refugees from Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia mingle. A gift of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that started in February 2022. He had that     vibe [Ill get into this later]. Light of possessions, untethered, in limbo,     or    , a drifter floating in the wind.   He translates on my behalf. A grievance from an American to a Georgian by a Ukrainian in Russian. Crop-top girl scowls and huffs out not too long after.  The Ukrainian is kind of cute. Plus weve bonded. I step out and wait on the front steps staring at my phone as he finishes his transaction. He says he is from a war-torn city and, yes, a refugee. He doesnt know if he can go to USA. I say why not through Mexico. Ah the black way he says. I ask if hes OK here in Georgia. He says yeah sure OK, hes been here before but overall not OK. A variation on what the Iranians here in Georgia say when I ask if they are happy. Iranians leaving that religious dictatorship for a better life were allowed in for a brief time in 2015. Now they are pestered at the border of a land that used to be part of their nation before the Qajar kings ceded the territories to Russia in the nineteenth century following years of war. I want to talk more but its awkward and hes on his way so thats that. Good luck with everything. What else can I do but hope he was able to get money from the machine. He says hes going to Europe to make his way to USAIll make it one day.  As the Ukrainian exits right, in walks from the left a little old man with a fishermans cap and a small accordion around his neck. I immediately snap a few stealthy photos, my favorite way to use my phone. At the corner he starts to play and sing. What a song. What a scene. Im still only around the corner from my apartment, not having made much progress on my errands. Its an old song of longing. His voice is slight. The intersection is loud. I leave coins and gesture if I can record him. The slightest nod. I dont even know what language he sings in. We make eye contact as he keeps repeating the song for me. Im teary-eyed.  This is happening in Saburtalo, my for-now neighborhood in Tbilisi, in this strange and unfamiliar world I sort of belong to after three months here. Its Fathers Day in the US. I interpret this scene as the poetry of me missing my father, whom I dont see often enough.  Im here to get as close to home as I can. Home. That word of words for immigrants, expats, refugees,   (  meaning displaced, stateless, exiled, homeless, nomad, someone with an incurable longing and unbelonging in the psyche and soul). The first three decades of my thirty-nine years away from my mother- and fatherland I was pretty fine assimilating. Hell, I was born in the West. But more and more Im consumed by Iran, that sitting cat. All the cities I havent known. All the places I could have seen. All the people I could have been.  My voluntary self-exile though: I minimize risk by avoiding entry into chaos. Though every place has its troubles. But the gash in me is growing. I search endlessly for Tehran, my childhood city, by now mythical to me. The way Tbilisi, or Teflis as I knew it in childhood, was. And now Im here in old Teflis.  As I age and consider the second half or maybe the last third of my life, I want retreat. Abdication from the society of jackals. To sequester myself in a pastoral Eden on a land of my own. Away from people and concerns of career and fame. But I dont know where that home could be. My partner and I could never agree on where to buy a house. Here, my Georgian friend grew up in several family homes he still visits. He is a father and cohabitates peacefully with his mother. His uncle tells him to return to their ancestral village home in the hills to tend the vineyard with him. My friend says home is where he feels like a baby. And strong. Which is why he could never live abroad. I envy him this feeling. I feel  . Ungrounded. In limbo between San Francisco, a Tehran I dont go to, Tbilisi, and many other places. Where to pitch that tent. Because of my voluntary exile from Iran, I visit the lands in proximity to her: Georgia and Armenia. Once part of the greater Persian empire, these lands have ancient ruins built on the bones of my ancestors. I dont know why that is so important. In the end the globe is one ancient ball and we're all dust. But the DNA is a zombie marching home. After three months of finding many Tehrans in Tbilisi, a city of sycamore-lined streets just like Tehran, I travel south to Yerevan, Armenia. It too is full of sycamores.  Im here for one reason.  My driver picks me up. We awkwardly walk to his dusty old Toyota Camry. When he puts my grimy red carry-on into his trunk I notice a stained pillow and blanket. The back seat doesnt appear to have a working seat belt. I fuss and say I cant drive in a car without a seat belt. Ive already alienated the situation. He pulls over to cancel the ride but I have a mission.  The gods have sent me an Armenian-Iranian to take me to the Armenian/Iranian border. My driver is a salt-of-the-earth middle-aged man of no pretenses and easy disposition. As a young man he moved to the US from Iran for a few years but found the dog-eat-dog too taxing so he came to Armenia. He is my brother-in-arms. Well into the ride we have broken the tension. He says in Persian, your own land is something else. He is talking about Iran. Hes lived in Armenia for thirty years, but hed go back to Iran if it ever became free.  Another way Iranians say this is     or  We dont have a country, or This is no country (for us).  I dont care about sights on the way south. I just want to be driven so I can take in the landscape, the topography of my own dust.  The road south is mountainous. First we have a clear view of Mount Ararat and Little Ararat next it. This mountain of the Armenian Highland, the national symbol of Armenia, is now just on the other side of the nearby Turkish border. Tourists pose with Ararat looming in the background on a platform with a carved-out opening designed exactly for this memento. The lesser Caucasus are rolling hills within hills, at times downy green, at times velvety fawn dappled with trees. We two Caucasians ascend to a series of mountains called Zangezur. The region was ceded to Russia by Qajar Iran in 1813 via the Treaty of Gulistan. We stop at bell towers and my driver tells me these bells were tolled to herald approaching enemy forces, hence the name: Zang meaning bell, e meaning of, and Zur meaning force.\" The bells of war. The landscape is bright green with little yellow wildflowers and large rectangular patches of purple wildflowers. I see people up to their waists in one of the distant patches. Reminded me of the lavender fields of Provence in the south of France whose tiny roads I drove through in my large white Ford the previous summer.  Summer 2021, just when international travel had opened up again after the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic seemed to be over. I traveled back to southern France thirty-seven years after I had been a high-school student there. I was returning with trepidation of the same estrangement and non-whiteness I had then, a brown girl with bushy eyebrows and post-pubescence kinky hair fleeing the Islamic Republic of Iranthat had recently transmogrified from its chic and glorious past of the Shah yearsfor America, Shangri-la.  In the US, I have been a hyphen, an other. But who and what I encountered in the summer of 2021 was a revelation. I remember exactly the moment I became (an) American. I was sitting in a regional branch of the BNP, Banque Nationale de Paris. The supposedly bilingual young man with a little office who should have been able to answer banking-101 questions, or so I thought, could not. In neither of our two languagesOK one language, his half English and my half French, and one translation appbetween us.  I dont know if being outraged at his substandard customer service was just my personal strategy for preemptively covering up my own discomfort with being yet again a foreigner, or if it was being accustomed to a certain level of service and the American the-customer-is-always-right ethoswhich dwindles as Americans cant actually live on working wagesor puffery from the general reverence bestowed upon me as an American when abroad, or just my intolerance of ineptitude. But here I was, Miss Demanding American.  And I loved her.  The American. Here in Georgia and Armenia, where I speak none of the languages, I can tell people deride my demandingness. Under their breath or outright: the American this, the American that, eyes rolling But I dont careyes, I care, I hate the scrutiny and contempt, I hate standing out, I hate being a fool in a fishbowlI do dress like all-American Ali MacGraw in Love Story: crisp white jeans, navy blue short-sleeved T-shirt, clean brown hair. Im Jackie-O strong.  I enjoy a privilege abroad I never have in the US. You take it where you can.  Twelve harrowing hours of driving through misty mountain passes dodging trucks that carry goods back and forth between Iran and Russia. One overnight stay in a hellish motel with vagrant men. And thirty minutes skirting the Armenian/Iranian border where the cretinous and ruthless border police make me delete all my sneaky photos of the barren toxic dump that the area is, a stinking toilet of splattered shit, nearly confiscating my phone and US passport.  The border mountains are stony and bone-dry. The atmosphere is apocalyptic. I narrowly escape. We backtrack. Behind a rusty metal shed and some burnt-out car parts at the foot of an electric barbed-wire fence my driver and I scrape some earth from this borderland.  But what difference does this earth make. I even forget the plastic bag in his trunk.

        "title": "Prophet Nina  Evergreen Review",
        "author": "Nina Ruth Mir",
        "text": "Anonymous, digital collage on canvas. Inspired by La Libert guidant le peuple, 1830, by Eugne Delacroix. The graffiti is from a wall in Tehran: \"A woman is her homeland\" (Zan Khood Vatan Ast).  Recently, I made a spontaneous  TikTok  post expressing my deep anger with the ongoing brutal oppression of peaceful Iranian protesters by the religious government of Iran. I called the government a fascist entity and asked my few viewers to punch anyone who vocally defended the Iranian governments actions, since punching fascists is considered halal in my own made-up religion, where I am the prophet of peace. Nina is not the name my parents gave me when I was born a few years after the 1979 revolution that saw the last Pahlavi king replaced with a bearded monster, a hard-liner daddy, a black turbanite, a vicious prosecutor, a ruthless judge, a grand ayatollah, a geriatric totalitarian, a self-appointed supreme leader of Irans streets, offices, bedrooms, grocery stores, hospitals, ports, cabins, rivers, deserts, swamps, cows, hawks, history, literature, poetry, cinema, theater, kindergartens, colleges, children, men, women, wombs, mouths, past, present, future, and everything, everywhere. I have always found it funny that while my parents were not religious and never bothered to teach me or my two siblings how to pray or fast according to Islamic teachings, they named me after one of the many nicknames of Prophet Muhammad as it conveniently rhymed with the names of my two older siblings. I am not going to divulge my dead name here because I want you to know me as Nina. I named myself Nina about seven years ago after self-identifying as a transfemme/nonbinary person. My inspiration was Nina Simonethe iconic black American artist and star of the twentieth century, who was an outspoken civil rights activist at a time of racial segregation. Eventually, after months of consideration, mental anguish, and suicidal thoughts, I decided to share that piece of personal news with my family members. They rejected me. As a consequence, I am not in touch with any of my relatives in Iran or abroad. It is tough and lonelyespecially so on my birthdays, the annual occasion of Persian new year, the night of winter solstice, or, anytime there are world or Olympic wrestling, volleyball, or football events involving Iranian athletes. But all these terrible feelings and thoughts are nothing compared to the pain that plainclothes officers of Irans byzantine, vast, and secretive security-intelligence apparatus are violently imposing on brave Iranian protesters in Tehran, Zahedan, Sanandaj, Mashhahd, Saqqez, Rasht, Ardabil, and many other cities. The protests started more than a month ago after the heartbreaking, senseless, and brutal kidnapping and subsequent murder of a twenty-two-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman, Jina Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the notoriously corrupt Iranian police. Up to now, there has been no indication that the government is going to listen to the demands of the protesters. It is clear the only tool in the toolbox of the Iranian state is their usual go-to device: an infinite loop of suppression, censorship, oppression, and murder of Iranian protesters.

[CC BY-SA 4.0]  After expressing myself on TikTok, I went out for a bicycle ride to Ocean Beach via the beautiful JFK Drive in Golden Gate Park, past the conservatory of flowers, a skating rink, the de Young Museum, all the lakes, all the meadows, all the buffaloes, and a Dutch windmill to the edge of the Pacific Ocean. Normally, riding my bicycle in San Francisco distracts me from awful, intrusive thoughts, but not on that day. Somehow all I could think of were images of me punching my older brother in the face, chest, and back, then in his face again. These thoughts felt right and cathartic at the time because I have hated my older brother most of my life. My brother lives in Tehran; I have not talked to him in more than a decade, and I doubt I will see him again. Regardless, these visions were unsettling and violent, and I am not a violent person. Later in the day, I became disgusted with myself and confused. In reality, I have never punched my brother. He is seven years older and always loved learning and practicing martial arts growing up. He made my childhood a nightmare. Because of his age, and my parents work schedule, he had many hours alone with me in a supervisory role. He was a violent person to be around. My parents knew he physically and verbally assaulted me, since he did all those in front of my parents eyes too. My parents didnt care a lot unless we had a guest at home. In that case, they would make sure their kids behaved according to the protocols of an imaginary respectable family that we were clearly not, but, apparently, strove for whenever we had an audience of random guests. In the context of Irans current situation, a readily available analogy would be my parents as the Supreme Leader Khamenei and his three useless branches of the Iranian government. My brother as the morality police enforcing his own protocols may or may not align with my parents goals. Obviously, I would be a typical Iranian girl in this lazy analogy. Further, I cannot comment on how the majority of Iranian families raised their children in the 80s, but I can report that I was caught off guard when I learned that other kids at my school liked or adored their older brothers. I think the first time I heard of such sibling dynamics was in fifth grade. At that time, I had a crush on a classmate who was okay at math and science like me, but was a star in soccer, basketball, and ping pong. He was brash and funny. I liked him like that. But, obviously, I never got to tell him how I felt because, in spite of not knowing the word for people like myself was gay, I knew it was extremely dangerous to express such gay feelings as a boy to another boy. Homophobia aside, I remember feeling sad that I didnt have a close relationship with my older brother like my crush had with his own three older brothers! What stung the most was the fact that I had to go back home after school. Every time I was home, I had to find ways to avoid contact with my older brother. I didnt feel safe around him but I had nowhere else to go to escape him. My parents house where I grew up in was a snug two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bathroom apartment in a four-story building between Laleh Park and Gisha neighborhood in a central part of Tehran with a variety of government offices, K12 schools, museums, mosques, churches, hospitals, a garrison, and different academic colleges. I loved my neighborhood but I hated my home. Museum of Contemporary Arts of Tehran in Laleh Park, Tehran, Iran. Photo: Mohade3ehh, via Wikimedia.  [CC BY-SA 4.0] Getting back to my lazy analogy, I can now see why my brother was so abusive to me. He was neglected by my parents and he didnt know what to do with his anger, discontent, and hopelessness. I feel sad for my brother now. But I still hate him. I stopped talking to my parents in 2010 after my first coming out as a gay person. Some years later, I tried talking to my mother during the pandemic lockdown while I was holed up in a dingy room in Oakland, CA. My mother texted me back saying that she couldnt speak with me. I asked around if she had a throat problem because that could be the only thing preventing her from speaking with me after many years of tortured communications. I gathered that she did speak on the phone with relatives and had no throat issues. That is when I understood her response. I tried once more a year later. She told me again that she could not speak on the phone with me. I wasnt disappointed or surprised at this outcome, since the summer before the pandemic, she had sent me a long letter condemning my gender transition and name change in response to my second coming out to her and my sister via text messages and emails. She has never called me Nina. Depressing familial problems aside, I wish there was less generational trauma in Iran, so that my brother or the current Iranian government didnt have to resort to brutal violence to express themselves. Interpersonal communications in Iran have never been the subject of a national conversation or educational campaign because (my two cents) most Iranians have always lived under a form of dictatorship or the dreary prospects of a looming disaster, such as famine, plague, or drought. Try to find a time that Iranian towns didnt experience dictatorship. The closest I can find is the constitutional revolution era (19051911) that resulted in the establishment of a parliament, a justice department, and a constitution modeled after the Belgian constitution. Sadly, all that progress ended with the arrival of World War I and a new British-Russian-backed dictatorial dynasty. This short era is also legendary for its flourishing free press, which offered insights and knowledge on the life and politics of Iran, shared news of faraway countries and continents, ongoing progress of global womens rights, modern education, and scientific progress, in addition to modern literature from around the world.

[CC BY 2.0]   Since my interaction with the Iranian community is minimal, I have been trying to follow the progress of these protests via Instagram, Twitter, and a couple of Farsi-language news outlets, BBC Persian and IranWire websites. I got very excited that some Iranian queers spoke at the historic Berlin protests in October ( 80,000 Iranians rallied in Berlin! ). It made me cry when I saw trans and gay flags and symbols in the pictures and video footage from the Berlin protest. However, I know better. I began to read the comments on a few Instagram posts that included images or videos of Iranian queers protesters in Europe or the US. I saw homophobic and transphobic commentary that I have come to expect from Iranian users online. These hostile sentiments are widely shared by both pro and anti-regime Iranians in my own experience. Then I saw an Instagram post from an Iranian trans woman, who is an interviewer, op-ed writer, and an LGBTQ rights activist based in Canada. She said even if these protests succeed in toppling the brutal Iranian regime, she would not leave Canada to move back to Iran, because she also knows better. The hard reality is that no matter the form of government in Iran, queers will not be safe in Iran. Maybe cis Iranian queers could get lucky to pull a rather safe life in a secular democratic Iran, where honor killings, forced sterilization, and corporal punishmentssuch as forced amputations of hands and fingers, floggings and death penalty for sodomyarent the societys norms. But I doubt trans people would have a chance in Iran in my lifetime. Judging by what numerous other countries have gone throughIndia, Japan, Mexico, the US, France, etc.its clear it will take Iran many decades to become a less deadly place for queer people. But what matters most is for our current government to sashay away without any more violence and mayhem. I understand what I just expressed sounds like a dream. And thats true. I have a dream. Nina Ruth Mir (they/them) is an Iranian person. They love riding their bicycle, doing nothing, ranting, daydreaming, and meeting weird people. When they were an 18-year-old closeted queer boi in Tehran, they never thought of getting beyond 30, let alone 40 years of age. As such, every day since their 30th birthday has been both a blast and a disappointment ",

This was before the digital age, before smartphones and apps that made it possible to speak and connect several family members on a group video call. Travelers back and forth between Iran were also few and far between, but any time an acquaintance was making the trip, they made sure to tell their friends and neighbors in case they wanted to send a small gift or a letter. At those times, Id watch my mother write for days, sitting at the dining room table in our tiny apartment, pouring her heart out to her sisters in page after page. I would watch her and wonder what she was putting down on paper, what could be so important? She would send pages and pages off to them, they would send just as many pages back to her, and shed spend almost as many days reading as she had spent writing.  Years later when my younger aunt arrived in this country from Iran, she brought with her my mothers letters, stacks of them. My mother also had stacks of her letters stored away, and brought them out to see how they corresponded to one another. What do they say? I asked. They were letters filled with everything theyd probably have wanted to say to them if theyd been sitting in the same room: Their hopes and wishes, their worries and ambitions for all of us, their fears, their sorrows, and small victories. Through the worst and best times, they wrote to each other. Somehow, my mother and her sisters had always found a way to share how they were feeling, to hope together, worry together, to dream for a better future togetherno matter the distance. Theyd kept up their correspondences for years, despite the time constraints of their lives and the distance between them. Most interesting of all, peppered throughout their letters was this sense of hope that someday, we would all be in the same place againnot temporarily, but just as before. How did the two of you know? We could barely speak on the phone at the time, what made you both think one day wed all be living close to each other again? Thats a lot of hope! Id say every time the topic of those letters would come up. , my aunt or mother would say.  Golafarin Razi was born in Tehran, Iran and raised in Tehrangeles (Los Angeles, California).

I learned to sound out the Cyrillic so that I could hear the music of rhythm and repetition, but I didnt learn Russian. Instead, I imagined what it would be like to understand the originals transparently. I held them shimmering in a space beyond the page, beyond English or Russian, beyond language. They were lighthouses. Those were perfect poems diamond in the crystalline perfection of their form lightning arcing through the air. Discovering poetry in Persian was different.

        "text": "Sun Ra Having completed an initial cycle of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Disney has begun to unleash the first installments in its new ten-year plan. Brace for the onslaught and a new opportunity to wonder how many variations on the same generic plot structure are needed to screw in the neon sign of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, a galaxy as full of variety and promise as it is frustrating in its commitment to the generic. It is arguably one of the great frustrations of the Age of Marvel that after it finally figured out the special effects to do justice to the expansiveness of the original comic books, Disney also worked overtime to distill and dilute all that was weird, silly, garish, elating about them into a surefire, hit-making formula. The hero may have a thousand faces and Disney a hefty roster of them at hand, but inside theyre also all made of the same flesh, and a lot of it is twice lab-grown, having gone through comic book assembly lines before reprocessing in Hollywood. In those circumstances, departures from formula become all the more significant. When Ryan Coogler directed  , he did not just bring fifty years of Black superhero comics to the screen; he was expressly inspired by all the Black writers and artists, from Billy Graham, Christopher Priest, Brian Stelfreeze, and Alitha Martinez to the Hudlin brothers, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Roxane Gay, all of whom contributed along the years to turn an often corny cat into a cultural icon. Coogler brought as Black Panthers main foe Killmonger, a cousin and polar inversion who could have been as cringeworthy as Bizarro, but turned out as existential a nemesis as Poes William Wilson, and sharing the same sharp fate. The film managed to simultaneously propose and absorb a notion that Killmonger made something painfully clear: however cool and well-meaning, a monarchand both these guys were monarchscant be a revolutionary. Still, working within these limits, Coogler made a way out of no way with humor and by sprinkling historical and political Easter eggs for those who would explore.  Tenoch Huert Meja as Namor (Eli Ad / Marvel Studios) , the second feature film focusing on the world of the African superhero, reprises the game of mirrors and inversions so central to  . It is sort of a mess shot through with glimpses of brilliance. It often feels like were watching Coogler fighting studios to try and say something meaningful in spite of plot choices and minute turns that may ultimately help build the MCU, but for now feel puzzling, if not outright nonsensical. Theres no shortage of attempts at recycling what made the first installment a worldwide hit: thus TChalla and Killmonger may be gone, but their dialectic, ideological opposition lives on in the plot of this sequel. Where Killmonger embodied a caricatural form of Black diasporic, decolonial anger, the new antagonist, Kukulkanknown by his enemies as Namor, a centuries-old quasi-deity as comfortable underwater as he is in the airand his nation of Talokan bring a deeper level of acolonial civilization: Indigenous Americans who found isolation from European encroachment at the bottom of the ocean and would rather lay waste to all than entertain any contact with white Westerners. Early in the film, we find ourselves following a US expedition out at sea. Using brand new detecting technology, their deep-sea divers find traces of vibraniumthe precious, extraterrestrial metal thought to only be found in Wakandaon the seafloor, seconds before an invisible foe destroys them. It is not much longer before the crewmembers on the US navy ship that carried them have to deal with a terrifying menace: an unknown sound mesmerizes them into walking off the ship straight into the water. Sailor after sailor drops into the dark ocean, prompted by the deep-sea sounds of Talokan. The scene will instantly evoke an episode of   when, sailing by the Island of the Sirenssea monsters whose song seduces all men who would hear itOdysseus, ever one to play, has his crewmates stop their ears with wax to neutralize the sonic threat and tie him to the mast to let him enjoy the music without risking death. Music will do things to you: in  , the deadly song is sung by a special unit of Namors Talokanil soldiers. What is charming about music can also be harmful: this important, if mostly unsung, idea wafts through  .  Sound has long been a crucial element in  : among the many properties of vibranium, Wakandas miraculous ore, is its ability to absorb and release all vibrations, including sound waves. The evil Klaw, TChallas enemy in his first comic book appearance, is armed with a vibranium-based contraption that can turn sound into solid, deadly creatures in his command. Though he was turned into a secondary, somewhat easily defeated character in  , Klaw retained a relation to sound, through his weapon, but also in his musical tastes. In his portrayal by Andy Serkis, he was a deranged, racist thug whose love of 90s Eurodance, if not deadly, nevertheless made for a distinctive part of his offensive arsenal. No surprise then, to find in Namor and the Talokanil, the other vibranium civilization, sound and sound-making objects front and center. When he bursts in on the retreat of Princess Shuri and Queen Ramonda of Wakanda, Prince Namor himself bestows a conch upon the two Wakandan women; blowing into the shell and submerging it in the ocean will summon him within minutes. The conch could easily be dismissed as one detail in a Marvel film typically packed with clues, hints, and other ties to the previous eighty years of comic book history and the next decade of superhero offerings. But the conch is also one in a cowry chain of references by which Coogler whispers questions on the place and role of culture and politics that have long animated the African diaspora. For all that it sits squarely in Disney and Marvels global takeover,   also allows glimpses into parallel histories and worldsif you listen closely. To wit:   pointedlyif succinctlynods at Haiti and, through it, at the greater history of Black revolt and resistance already indirectly hinted at in Cooglers first adaptation of the comic book  . Thus the conchs of Talokan necessarily resonate with their special characteristic as instruments of the Caribbean basin in general, and of the Maroons in particular. Enslaved people escaping oppression to form independent communities in mountains and other difficult terrain throughout the slaveholding Americas, Maroons used conch shells as a mode of communication, warning, and military organization; they are still used in vodoun ceremonies and to call audiences to attention before the telling of a tale. The somber, deadly use to which the Talokanil put conchs in   evokes precisely these functions: ever ready to do the Wests dirty work (but WHY? no satisfactory answer ever emerges), Wakandans decide to stand up to Talokan in a war that ends in a bloody stalemate. When Wakandan ships set out to meet the Talokanil on their surf, it is the African sailors turn to jump into their watery grave, seduced by the submarine sound. If the first instance echoed Greek myth, this scene hits differently. Theres a long, dreadful history of Africans jumping or being thrown off ships, one of the layers of horror pertaining to the Atlantic slave trade that comes with its own terrifying accounts and rousing myths. Think of Igbo Landing on Saint Simon Island in Georgia, named after the dozens of enslaved Africans who after taking over the slave ship transporting them from Africa and running it aground, decided to drown themselves in the marsh rather than risk being recaptured. Think of the  , the English slave ship at the center of a 1783 insurance trial called to adjudicate whether or not the 142 people thrown overboard by the crewmemberssome jumping on their ownwere a loss covered by the ships insurance. The watery grave dissolves all bodies and bones; it disappears material evidence but not souls. In the postface to her poem  , M. NourbeSe Philip advances that hers is an effort at catching the voices of the many thousands gone echoing in the bone beds of the sea. Some have preferred to imagine a true afterlife: in their 1992 album  , electronica duet Drexciya imagined an eponymous underwater civilization made up of water-breathing aquatically mutated descendents of those unfortunate victims of human greed thrown over the sides of slave ships. At the end of  , Killmonger let himself die rather than risk being saved by Wakandan tech only to be kept in a cage for his crimes. Before breathing his last, he uttered these memorable last words, tying his brand of individual rage to a communal history of hurt and loss: Bury me in the ocean, with my ancestors that jumped from the ships, because they knew death was better than bondage. Its doubtful that Wakandan authorities followed his wishes; had they heeded the words of the American black sheep of the family, they might have found out earlier about the Talokanil, their cousins from a different toxin, and who knows what an alliance, rather than a fight, might have yielded. If only things had started differently. The superhero genre is keen on origins. Superpowers, whether granted by technology or magic, have to be explained, accounted for; whether caused by revenge, a sense of duty, or mere entertainment, vigilantism has to be justified. A criminal kills your parents, your uncle, your family, your entire people; you now solemnly vow to devote your life to preventing this from happening again, channeling your desire for revenge into generalized wild justice. A formula happened upon accidentally in a government lab, or a company lab, or a dash of chemical waste, a magical plant, a meteorite from outer space grants you the amazing powers necessary to make you more than just a resentful malcontent raging against fate: armed with resolve and the power to destroy worlds, you can now arrest petty criminals for breakfast, evil geniuses for lunch, and supervillains in the evening, when the light gets all dramatic and all the cats are gray. Yet the possibility remains that you chose darkness to begin with, or that you will be tempted to when you unavoidably begin again, as the genre demands. Ultimately, though, few are those grandiose antiheroes in the Magneto or Namor mold. This world cannot thrive on uncertainty. Temptation and doubt are par for the coursethey make things interesting, dramatically speaking, but too much of an interesting thing can bog down progress. Especially in the simpler days of the Golden Age of superheroes (1930s50s), the strength of superheroes has been their ability to trust in their moral compass. Not unironically, this resonates with the decidedly amoral Friedrich Nietzsche, a mustachioed German not without influence on the birth of the superhero genre: he once considered the perfection of a life so bereft of regrets one could live and relive it again and again without changing a thing. In  , he revealed his formula of [his] happiness: a Yea, a Nay, a straight line,  ....  We must imagine superheroes happy: content in the knowledge that they are always right.  Granted, some level of complexity came with the years. The Silver Age (1960s) saw the company introduce their own formula for happiness: teenage angst, embodied in the likes of Spiderman and the X-Men. Stan Lee and his crew struck gold when they came up with mutants, a narrative conceit designed for anyone suffering from injustice to identify with. Misunderstood misfits in a society that simultaneously reviles, fears, and wants to exploit them, mutants are constantly targeted by enemies claiming that their very nature is a menace and an insult to humanity. Mutants can always be read asand are often undeniablythinly veiled stand-ins for oppressed racial, ethnic, sexual, gender groups. They are a narrative structure that allows writers to tap into real historical instances of such oppression for material. The genius of it is that it allows to eat ones cake and have it too: you dont have to speak about race to speak about race, and for exactly that reason, you can always claim that you werent. Or that you were, as you see fit.  Illustration by Bill Everett. \"The Submariner.\"   (1939) This formula, or at least elements of it, predates the Uncanny X-Men. Consider the terms in which the origins of Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner, are presented in his first ever appearance in  , in 1939. An American scientific expedition in the Arctic circle wrought desolation on the submarine civilization of Atlantis by unwittingly dropping depth charges onto the city. White Earth men nearly exterminated our entire race, Namors mother reminds him. Sent by her father the king to find thy way into the hands of these white monsters, there to work your feminine wiles to our racial advantage, Namors mother ended up falling in love with the American captain, eventually giving birth to a mixed baby endowed with incredible powers: the ability to fly, breathe out of water, the strength of a thousand men. After Namors first personal confrontation with surface humans, she spells out his mission in life in no uncertain terms: My son, it has taken us twenty years to build up a race to avenge the brutal harm done us thenIt is your duty to lead us into battle!... Go now to the land of the white people! Harsh words, but also word censors would be hard put to find exception to: Atlantis is far enough from the real world, any similarity to actual people, alive or dead, done dirty by Europeans and their descendants is purely coincidental. Carry on. Illustration by Bill Everett. \"The Submariner.\"   (1939) Mamas boy is nothing if not dutiful: for a few episodes, he engages Americans and destroys everything he finds: a lighthouse here, a random infrastructure in New York city there. But Namor is noble, of course; he saves damsels in distress, even the American ones. He kills Nazis on a whim, or possibly out of a sense of fairness, as he happens upon them attacking a civilian ship. It falls to a pure-hearted woman to convince him that he is mistaken about Americanswhom, it must be noted, he calls white devils: The Americans are not bloodthirsty! We are a gentle, easy-going race, unless we are aroused by injustice or intolerance on the part of our neighbors!... we are kind, and all we want is peace and law and orderwe fight only for that! Namor trusts no one, but he buys this, the fool, until a few episodes later a new slight reminds him that you really cant trust Americans. Until he does again, ad nauseam. From the beginning, then, Namor resonated with echoes to colonial history in general, and Black history in particular. In the way he is stuck between two worlds, belonging to neither; in the hatred he bears for the genocidal nation that birthed his father, in the way he carries the flag of his mothers disgracewhose love story is not without echoing the way some speak of Pocahontas or Sally HemingsNamor the avenging son is nothing if not an underwater tragic mulattowithout the issue of actual Blackness.  Illustration by Bill Everett, \"Prince Namor, The Submariner.\"   (1939) Origins must be remembered and will be routinely revisited, remolded, updated. The irony of it. Namors   waxed in the 1940s but it also waned, the merman diving underwater only to resurface on several occasions in the 1950s. He was reinstated in   (1961) (two years before, Captain America, another Golden Age hero, was literally pulled out of the ice to come grace the pages of Marvel comics). In this issue, the Human Torch comes across an amnesiac homeless man living in the streets of New York, and recognizes him as none other than Namor, whose old adventures he just happened to be reading in comic book form right before encountering him. What are the chances? The 1962 comic reboots Namors origin story with, well, a vengeance: Atlantis has been destroyed by nuclear testing, this time around and on finding out, Namor vows revenge on the entire human race. You know the drill. Namor went on to become one of Marvels most anti heroic staples, in spite ofor, possibly, thanks tohis haughty demeanor and puzzling pronouncements (he is prone to shout the dubiously Latin phrase Imperius Rex! as he goes into battle, for no apparent reason). Stan Lee and Jack Kirby,   (1961) The new origin story Marvel Studios concocted for 2022 Namor is weaved of old familiar threads: bringing to the surface historical colonial motifs that were only indirectly stated, but also erasing in the process the specifically anti-American character of Namors anger. In the sixteenth century, Spaniards took over the Yucatn peninsula and spread new diseases that ran through the local population like wildfire. Desperately looking for ways to survive, a group of people started consuming a plant altered by vibranium, that gave them the power to breathe underwater. A power and a curse then, as they consequently lost the ability to live on the surface, and built a new world underwater, Talokan. Gone is old Namors tragic hybridity: conceived on the surface,  s Namor was the first Talokanil baby born underwater. In this transition, he gained special powers none of his compatriots (neither born above nor those conceived and born below) share. Worshipped from birth as a king by the Talokanil, he is soon equated with the fearsome Kukulkan, the feathered Serpent of the Mayan Pantheon. On taking his deceased mother to the surface to be buried in the land of her birth, the young boy happens upon a scene of horror; the Spaniards have taken over his ancestral land and enslaved the local population. Kukulkan and his people raze the colony to the ground, slaughtering every colonizer in sight. As he expires, a Spanish priest gives him his surface name with his last outraged breath: eres un nio sin amor. The El Tri song by the same title tells the tale of an orphaned street kid no one cares about; here, the phrase is uttered as a puzzling reproach. Unclear why the religious caution of a band of genocidal maniacs would expect a child among their victims to show them love, but here we are. The Submariner keeps the final syllables as his fearsome surname, NAMOR. Revenge has a new champion. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby,   (1961) Sun Ra.  Black Panthers origin story has been told and retold, as has been the story of his origins, planted in the blood-soaked ground of Civil Rightsera USA.  It goes like this: in June, James Merediththe African American activist who had desegregated the University of Mississippi four years earlierwas shot two days into a March against Fear in support of voter registration drives in the Jim Crow South. Stokely Carmichael, the chairman of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee had led such drives for years. A year earlier, he had notably helped locals in the 80% Black Alabama county of Lowndes to constitute their own party in opposition to the white supremacist branch of the Democratic Party.  Lowndes County Freedom Organization Voting Pamphlet (1966). c/o The Freedom Archives. The Lowndes County Freedom Organization adopted a crouching black panther as a symbol to make visibly clear their difference from the Democratic Partys white rooster. The pale cocks won the election in May 1966. By June 1966, Carmichael had had enough of the MLK-led movements tactics. This is 1966 and it seems to me its time out for nice words, he proclaimed; Its time Black people got together.  Black Power a slogan you could have mistaken for a comic book title, had there been any significant Black superheroes at the time. Yes, yes. You can see this coming like a radioactive spider: were not quite done with the origin story yet. In July 1966, Black Panther, the superhero, made its first appearance in  ; in October 1966, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton of Oakland California formed the Black Panther Party, borrowing LCFOs logo and something of Marvel superheros dark-clad swagger. There was a lot of Black Panther to go around in 1966.  But thats not all, and theres a case to be made about how recovering the circumstances of the Black Panthers advent shines an interesting light on this recent Hollywood treatments.  Jon Savage makes a case for seeing 1966 as the year the decade exploded, a turning point for pop music, a moment where finally, in the UK as in the US, the music echoed the social and political upheaval around. Yet arguably, pop experimentation paled in the face of the sonic revolution already started a few years earlier in free jazz. And here also, 1966 was a very good year. Fresh off the success of  , John Coltrane released  , one of four albums that year, this one proclaiming his engagement with the so-called New Thing: a radical, improvisational, iconoclastic approach to music led by a vanguard of young Black musicians, many of whom (Cecil Taylor, Ornette Coleman, Don Cherry, Archie Shepp) also released recordings that year as well. So did another jazz musician included in this broad new galaxy, though very much in his own system: Sun Ra, a celestial body whose gravitational pull attracted most of the bright stars of the Black Arts era.  Sun Ras origin story, unsurprisingly, is one of revision and rebirth. Born Herman Blount in Birmingham, AL in 1914, he was in his twenties already a music prodigy, even though he destined himself to a career in education. While in college he had a revelation about his purpose on this Earth after he was contacted by aliens and, through a process of transmolecularization, taken to Saturn. There, he was told secrets for him to share, when the time came, to save the planet, and which he would communicate through his language of choice: music. Leaving Birmingham for Chicago in the late 1940s, he did not just continue on his musical path; in the Windy City, he came into his own and unto his new name and developed a philosophy cross-pollinating his interest in the Bible as secret code of knowledge, Ancient Egypt, esoterism, Black history, space, and music. He and his galactic crew landed in the Big Apple in 1961 and immediately started spreading the cybernetic word. Even in the home of the New Thing their weirdness was unequaled. Some found them hard to take seriously, looking as they did, decked out in garish garbs evoking both Ancient Egypt and the space age.  Sun Ras galactic sounds and visuals have been celebrated rightfully for the past three decades as a foundation of Afrofuturism; he is also evidence of the complexity of the political and activist strands of the genre and of the way in which they were expressed. Sun Ra provided the soundtrack to the Black Arts Movement, quite literally, as when he and his Arkestra performed on a flatbed truck in the streets of Harlem to announce the opening of LeRoi Jones Black Arts Repertory Theatre. Ras philosophy is an explosive mix of Afro-pessimism and celestial optimism. In this present, Black people can only exist as myths because the present was designed to deny Black existence. There is no saving the now, but an alter-destiny can be developed. The utter weirdness of Ras demeanor and music was never random: in Old English,   meant having power to control fate. So it evidently did for Ra. He manifested as a presence sent to you by your ancestors, a myth produced before history, when and where Black people still held control over their fate, to hint at a faraway horizon from this brutal present.  : no surprise then that the myths of the future, which Ra proposed to build through music, echo with the same gospel of change spread by Lauren Olamina, the protagonist of Octavia Butlers uncannily familiar and prescient  . In the familiar hellscape that is Butlers 2024 USA, weather and arson have turned California into a field of constant fire; roaming bands of drugged-up thugs rape and pillage their way through neighborhoods with complete impunity while an increasingly conservative political class paves the way for giant companies to take over, reinstating company towns and slavery under any other name. Space could be our future, the young woman says to her father early in the novel, trying to convince him that we have to be going some place other than down the toilet.  Intrigued but unconvinced, her old man dies, killed by apocalyptic agents of this dreadful new world. Lauren keeps going, carrying her cosmic dream for all of humanity. It didnt come from nowhere.  The  s November 1966 issue, dedicated to the Black Power movement, featured Will the Circle be Unbroken?, a peculiar short story written by Henry Dumasone of Ras most exalted disciplesbringing music onto page to explore the possibility of a future myth.   Rumors are swirling in Will the Circle be Unbroken? Probe, the famed jazzman (soprano saxophone, like Coltrane), is back from exile, and it appears that in his travels he has somehow obtained a mysterious new instrumentthe afro-horn. He is now spreading the gospel of the new sound, playing only in select venues and for strictly Black audiences. Few have heard it, but those in the know say that the afro-horns vibrations are lethal to white listeners.  Jan, Ron, and Tashathree white hipsters, a musician, a scholar and a journalist, honorary Black people, or so they thinkhave heard all about it and believe none of it. They know better, you see. Some are born to sweet delight, some are born to endless night, and some take it all for granted. Special as they are, they have caught wind that Probe will be blowing at the Sound Barrier Club tonight, and so they show up, even though the doorman says Sessions for Brothers and Sisters only. No matter: the three hipsters hail a cop who helps them force their way into the club. They walk in, three ghosts, like chaff blown from a wasteland, just as Probe summons the motives necessary to sound his afro-horn. Well never know if Jan, Ron, and Tasha ever understood that the tall tales were true: they collapse where they sit, their hearts falling silent in respect for truer vibrations.  According to Sun Ra, he and his Arkestra were like space warriors. Music can be used as a weapon, as energy. The right note or chord can transport you into space using music and energy flow. And the listeners can travel along with you.  What he brought in his music was alien sonic technology with Black purpose. This did not always go over well with the people most directly concerned. Acting as himself in the 1974 film  , Ra appears in full regalia in front of a group of Black kids gathered in a youth center, walls covered with posters of the faces of the Black Arts and politics: Frederick Douglass, Angela Davis, Amiri Baraka, Eldridge Cleaver, Jimi Hendrix, George Jackson, Malcolm X, Stokely Carmichael, etc. They scoff at him, his shoes (What are those!  s Shuri might exclaim), and they have the following exchange: How do you know Im real? Im not real, Im just like you. You dont exist in this society. If you did, your people wouldnt be seeking equal rights. Youre not real; if you were, youd have some status among the nations of the world. So we are both myths. I do not come to you as the reality, I come to you as the myth, because thats what black people are: myths.  I came from a dream that the black man dreamed long ago. Im actually a presence sent to you by your ancestors. I'm going to be here until I pick out certain one of you to take back with me.  What if we wont come? Youre going to make us come? Then Im going to have to do you like they did you in Africa: chain you up and take you with me. Are there any whiteys up there? Theyre walking there today. They take frequent trips to the Moon: I notice none of you have been invited. How do you think youre going to exist? The year 2000 is right around the corner. Black people are not welcome in the US space race; but they are  , and they have mastered technologies tapped into the cosmos and apt to send them beyond history and this earthly plane to build the myths for the future: art in general and music in particular, always, already.  While Sun Ra was compatible with many figures involved in radical politics, Amiri Baraka foremost among them, he systematically shunned politics, when he did not defend deeply conservative, if cosmic, views.  Such positions did not sit well with more grounded elements of the Black Power scene: he was expelled from a Black Panther Party house in San Francisco in 1971, an episode that likely influenced the scene above from  . Speaking of this real-world rift, Daniel Kreiss argues that at its core lay a disagreement on how each respective party saw fit to use technology for Black advancement: where Sun Ra appropriated artifacts and technological metaphors to create a mythic consciousness of technologically empowered racial identity that would enable blacks to recreate and invent technologies and construct utopian societies on outer space landscapes, the Panthers redeployed and reconceived technologies to create a revolutionary consciousness with the end of political mobilization.  Kreiss ultimately suggests that time may have proven Ra right in one regard: half a century into that future, with the Panthers a thing of the past and their political legacy erased, obfuscated, slandered, or sanitizedor when it could not be destroyed, appropriated: see how the Panthers breakfast and homework-help programs predated and possibly influenced the federal Head Start and School Breakfast Programsby former opponents, critics and remote admirers alike, their brand of decolonial socialism more alive in dreams than in society, they could be said to have endured most lastingly as myth. A cynical take, maybe; an endless circle, surely: art ages better than politics, and for seeming more innocuous and evasive than pamphlets, metaphors and myths fly more easily under the radar. You can harness images, but they will also always elude you. In Will the Circle be Unbroken? all Jan the white hipster has to do to get past security at the Sound Barrier club is to call in a beat copin the real world, how much does, can an axe weigh against a billy club and gun? He goes in, satisfied he can consume the music like he has many times before, only to die trying to capture or elude the panthers of the music as waves of sound wash over him. For Dumas certainly, for Sun Ra arguably, the most dangerous panthers were not in the streets of Oakland but creeping in the very music, ready to pounce when least expected, performing in a mythical version of the revolutionary ways promoted by the Black Marxists.   Imagine a metal from outer space able to absorb vibrationssound and alland unleash them in endless possibility: cosmic technology for a far-out sound.   Henry Dumas did:   Hear the horn echoing all the way to, from, Wakanda. Vibranium, the precious metal everybody wantswhose uses include enhancing the impact of sound wavesis one of the rare things on this Earth (though not of it) never to have been exploited industrially by white people. The Indigenous African and American who claimed custody of it have become something different from mere humans. When Namor sets on his path of revenge in  , he digs up an ancient Atlantean instrument, a trumpet-horn that can summon Giganto, a submarine behemoth which the prince then proceeds to sic onto the surface world. If musicians are warriors, instruments are weapons. This is hardly a new metaphor; saxophones have long been called axes, a double entendre Dumas himself used from both edges in this very story. Myths will turn metaphors literal to devastating effect.  Stan Lee, Jack Kirby.   (1961) Theres no telling if Dumas ever read the original  , but we do know that Sun Ras myth shufflingif not his myth-buildinghad that same fateful year of 1966 intersected with this most ubiquitous of twenty-first century myths: the superhero. In January 1966, he and the Arkestra collaborated with a friendly neighborly East Village white band, The Blues Project, on a record designed to cash in on the   craze with far-out takes on the famed TV series theme and other superhero-related musical offerings. Its more than possible that  s writers, all or some, have read Dumas. It matters little, one way or another. Myths are not just to be found on paper: they travel the spaceways. Call it a peculiar cosmic phenomenon, but distinct echoes to Will the Circle be Unbroken? and, beyond it, to Sun Ras music and myth science can be heard and seen in the   films: it was an axe that Killmonger sought to liberate from a British museum in  . Its with the afro-horn, his axe, that Dumass Probe means to cut the deadwood of the world. And it is with his Afrofuturist cosmic sounds that Sun Ra went about unmooring the expectations of the surface world. Consider the puzzled reaction of French jazz critics, versed in politics and history but entirely baffled by the Arkestras Superman costumes and references to an Africa of the mind, an invention of Africa by blacks from Harlem and elsewhere a mythic Africa, a bricolage, a vision of Africa wholly invented by Western culture by the way whites represent Africa to themselves.  It was precisely in their dedication not to subscribe to musical, cultural, and political respectability, in their unsettling nature, that Ras myths without mythology breathed revolution, even as Ra himself appeared to speak against it.  The Strange Truth of Eternal Myth/Is the Sound, Sun Ra states in one of his poems.  If anywhere, sound may also be where the truth of a finely honed global blockbuster like   resides. Ponder the fact that for all its mastery of vibranium, Wakanda is the one party in presence that does the least with sound: hero status is politically neuteringfor all the good intentions attached to the kingdom of Wakanda, the best it can ever be is a high tech, trendy but harmless ditty, Muzak blasted over the quirky outer space sounds it discreetly draws inspiration from. Beware the power of sound, it means to warn us: in the wrong handsKlaws evil hands, Killmonger and Namors vengeful onessound can hurt. But even the loudest Muzak cannot drown out the melodies that sing beneath. The Talokanil sirens song, for what faint but seductive and deadly echoes of better worlds it carries, may be the one thing   ultimately delivers, somewhat in spite of itself: even Disney cannot fully harness the strange truth of eternal myth.

It was a dreadful ailment because it was very soft, and sometimes Cunningham thought he might only be imagining it. And he was afraid to see a doctor about this condition. He couldnt bear the wait at the city clinic, but more than that, Cunningham knew there was never good news from a doctor. Cunningham spent a few moments fiddling with his tie at the mirror under the weak overhead light in his room. Cunningham never had liked the look of his face. His cheeks were fleshy and spotted with red, as though he had a permanent rash. His mouth was crooked, his lips seemed not to ever properly close. He was discouraged by his ears, too, for one seemed higher up than the other. He had scrutinized the shape of his mouth and his weak chin and his uneven ears, he had moved his head to all angles, hoping for even one acceptable glimpse of himself; and when he tried to smile Cunningham was especially disappointed by his appearance. Some people are just ugly, he reasoned. Some people must just go through life ugly and cock-eyed, and they try to accept it, and then they cultivate some other part of themselves: a good character, or humor, or they do good things. There are cripples who adjust to their conditions; there are the simple-minded who find some sort of happiness.  The wallpaper in his hotel room was bruised and stained, pulled and tearing at the seams; it displayed a faded pattern of a flock of seagulls soaring over an island.  People did try to be nice to Cunningham. He frequently encountered a young married couple on the clacking gate elevator when he rode down; the man would smile at him, the woman would smile and nod. There was a very sweet, very pretty young blond man who worked behind the desk of the hotel. He greeted Cunningham every morning as Cunningham left for work, he remarked on the weather, which had been dreary and cool for so long now. Sometimes, Cunningham tried to smile at the blond man. It was difficult for Cunningham to look a handsome man in the eye.  In winter, it did not snow in this city, it rained; Cunningham was raised with snow, he expected it, so its absence seemed a sad deprivation and somehow fraudulent. By morning the walks and streets were burnished and gray and littered. Green and gold garlands were twined round the lampposts along the streets; blinking white lights and wreaths and paper Santa Clauses were in the windows of the apartment buildings; and saddest of all, strings of colored bulbs were weaved through the bare, black branches of the trees in the park.  Cunningham was reflecting as he walked the few blocks to his job: people must think he was a depressed man, that he was unhappy and lonesome; or maybe they conceived that some tragic thing had happened to him.  There was an elderly lady with an accent who worked at the doughnut shop near his office building; she wore a pressed handkerchief pinned at her breast and eyeglasses on a thick silver chain; she always smiled so warmly to Cunningham and sometimes would give him two sweet rolls instead of one. But Cunningham kept his head lowered and his scarf lifted, to cover his chin.

Attention: Complaint Department Dear Sirs: \tRecently I purchased this can of Coso Creamed Corn which I have enclosed. I opened up the can and found the cream, but no corn. The can even seemed a little light to me when I picked it up at the market. I have been buying Coso products for many years now and have never been disappointed before. I sincerely hope you will give me a refund. The cream without the corn just isn't fair. Thank you,  Mrs. S. Shipley Coso Canned Foods, Inc. Dear Complaints Department: \tSomething got screwed up somewhere. We wanted lima beans, and that's what the label on the can said. But inside were some red things. Kidney beans, I think. My wife washed out the can, and then we put the red things in a little paper sack, and that's all in the box with this letter. We just want our money back. We're not out to sue or anything.  Yours, Nick Nayles COSO FOODS, INC. COSO FOODS GENERAL COMPLAINTS DIVISION Dear Complaints Division: I have never never written a letter of this type before. It is now four in the morning, and I am so angry I can't even get to sleep. So I figure my best bet is just to write to you people and get it off my chest. \tThe problem is with your company's Beef & Noodles. Which I don't even like canned food very much, but it's fast and easy to make and last night I just needed something fast and easy to make.  \tI may as well tell you, I am disabled. I have aluminum fake hip sockets and it turns out something's wrong with them, they aren't working right and I have to have them replaced. Which is going to cost about seventeen-thousand-million dollars, of course. So, anyway, I'm disabled. Nothing's easy for me, not a goddamn thing. So last night I went for some dinner and, like I say, I wanted something fast and easy to make. So I pick out a can of your company's Beef & Noodles. I open the can, I sit down to rest for a minute, because I only can even stand up for a minute or so at a time. I've got this glop in a pan on the stove. It's all heated up, I dump it in a bowl. I'm exhausted from riding the goddamn bus all day and everything, from going to the doctor's and everything. And what do I find in my bowl of Beef & Noodles? A piece of glass as thick as my hand. I swear it's the bottom of a Coca-Cola bottle. I'm thinking, great, just great, now I'll have to have my esophagus or my intestines or some damn thing replaced with aluminum  if they even make aluminum esophaguses and intestines.  So the piece of the glass is in this envelope here and it has a little bit of dried Beef & Noodle sauce on it, to prove what I'm saying is true. I would like my money back, I would like an apology. I would like a free can of this goddamn stuff, or a case of it or whatever. Or go give a bunch of your products to the homeless, starving people. Lots of them are disabled just like me. I mean, doesn't your company have any goddamn heart? Well, I've looked over what I've written so far. I guess I feel a little better. I guess these things do happen. A company that's as old and good as yours, I'm sure you'll make things right, however you do it. I really don't mean to sound like some crazy complaining person. I mean, I have no idea who's even reading this letter. So, don't take it personally.  Everybody's got problems. But, after all, I am disabled. Just getting through the day is sometimes a goddamn trial for me. And this Coca-Cola bottle in my food was, I guess it was just the last straw if you know what I mean.  What I'm trying to say is, I guess, life has a lot of suffering in it. Sincerely, L. Ubell P.S. And by the way, after thinking it over, I am pretty sure this is a problem for you to deal with, not the Coca-Cola people. Dear Coso Foods: I notice that many of your competitors run little contests and sweepstakes and things of that nature. Maybe you could do something like that. Like a lucky label or something along those lines. Just a suggestion. Signed, A customer Cunningham would have a hamburger and some soup for lunch at a coffee shop near his building. Each afternoon he would sit at a window table, read through the newspaper, finish his meal with a piece of cream pie and some coffee. During that Christmas season, a portable radio perched precariously on a shelf over the counter played the well-loved carols and jingles. His usual waitress had had a cast on her arm for some weeks; Cunningham did not inquire about it, but he tipped her well. Like his room, like his office, this window table at the coffee shop was contained, predictable, known. Cunningham himself was knownhis irregular face and joyless expression and weak build formed a muddy wash of familiar discontent.  Of course Cunningham didnt like to think that this would always be his life. Without change, without diversion. So he didnt speak, except to politely give his order. Every day at this coffee shop he glanced up from his newspaper discreetly, furtively, but often, to watch each customer or group enter and leave. He listened to the conversations of the people in the small booths against the walls; he listened to the couple of old men at the counter, or the few regular middle-aged women who came in for ice cream. He watched people's gestures and moods. He overheard broad, generous laughter, quick whispers, sharp tones. He wasnt amused or fascinated; he was detached. Cunningham had the ideaas fearsome as it was thrillingthat one of these days, something extraordinary would happen to him. One of these days perhaps he would be noticed. Coso Canned Foods, Inc. Attention: The Chairman of the Board Dear Sir or Madam: Enclosed, please find three labels which I removed from your products: one can of Coso's Fancy Fruit Cocktail, one can of Coso's Pear Halves, and one can of Coso's Peaches in Syrup. The lot numbers of these items are written on the left-hand, bottom corner of the respective labels. \tIt happens to be the Peaches in Syrup with which I take issue. I am a newlywed. William and I were married four weeks ago (as of this writing) here in town, but William's parents happen to live in Cleveland. They came out to visit us just after the honeymoon. For a variety of reasons, I had never met William's parents. Naturally, you can understand how anxious I was to make a good impression on them. I planned what I considered to be a fairly elegant dinnerroast beef and spinach souffle. I must say, things were going along just fine. Splendid, in fact. Until I brought out dessert. Now, for dessert, I thought it would be nice to have different fruits in attractive bowls and then have little cups and everyone could have what most appealed to them. I thought this was a tasteful, creative (yet inexpensive) idea. So in three of my good red and white bowls I emptied each can of Coso fruit, and put them on a tray with matching red and white little cups and my good dessert spoons (which actually William's mother had given to us).  So William took some of the pear halves. His father took some of the fruit cocktail. And as the little tray is being passed around, everyone is saying how pretty it looks and what a grand idea it is. And then William's mother chose to have a cup of your Peaches in Syrup and she spooned two or three into her cup, then spooned some syrup over them. Well, I turned my back and then I heard this commotion because William's mother had dropped her spoon and William was asking what the trouble was. I was saying, well, let me get you another spoon, and I looked at William's mother and her face was just ashen. We all were asking what the trouble was. (I thought she was having a stroke, for God's sake.) What it turned out to be was a cockroach the size of a quarter floating right in her syrup. It was alive, too, because we all saw it crawl onto one of the peaches and just sort of sit there wiggling its horrid little legs.  Perhaps this letter seems too detailed to you, but I simply want to stress the depth and magnitude of the situation. I mean, I really did think William's mother was having a stroke! And then to find out that this vile thing is scurrying about in her cup. I am terribly distraught. This incident completely ruined the dessert, of course, and to say it put a damper on the rest of the evening is quite the understatement. When we moved to the living room for our coffee, well, we were all just speechless. As for making a good impression on my new parents-in-law, I imagine it goes without saying that it will be some time before this outrageous debacle is lived down. Unlike my husband William, I do not accuse one of your factory workers of deliberately planting an insect in the can as some kind of perverse practical joke. I am assuming the vulgar thing crawled in there and was sealed up quite by accident. (Though that he was in your factory at all violates every health code, I'm sure!) So, giving the benefit of the doubt, I am asking for full reimbursement of my can of Peaches in Syrup, as well as of the other two varieties of your company's canned fruit which I purchased and served. (Need I say that the entire contents of all three bowls had to be discarded immediately and my good bowls, cups and spoons thoroughly washed?) I am assuming that your response to this letter will be a prompt repayment. I cannot imagine that someone in your position would question the truth of what I have said or trivialize my embarrassment or trauma. I mean, after all, thanks to Coso's Peaches in Syrup, my relationship with my husband's family is strained, to say the least. It will be a very, very long time before I dare to serve (or they dare to eat!) any meal at my table again. Though I would appreciate any condolence or apology you cared to offer, I will expect and be satisfied with a check from your company as soon as possible.  Furthermore, I hope you will do everything in your power to make certain such a hideous thing does not happen again  however, if it does, it will be to some other unsuspecting woman who simply wants to please her husband's family. I will not be buying Coso canned goods again. I remain, Eunice Trevor-Hall Coso Canned Foods, Inc. Dear Complaints People: We think there is a problem with your mandarin orange sections. We think they're tangerines. Love, \tChloe Braverman Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1989, enamel with Splash Zone on wood panel, 48 1/2 x 97 x 2 inches Cunningham always retired early. He smoothed a white, soapy cream over his cheeks and under his eyes. He kept a dim table lamp on by his bed and put himself to sleep reading paperback British mystery novels; but the stories acted upon Cunningham as a hazardous hypnotic drug might have, all of the characters and plots, the cleverness and revelations fused, blended into irrelevant unity; so in the mornings Cunningham remembered nothing and was agitated, fearful. One night Cunningham woke suddenly. In his hands he felt that terrible, hot numbness he had experienced a few years before. The travel alarm clock on the bureau read just after four A.M. Cunningham rose and draped himself with the tan raincoat he kept on a hook behind the door. He opened the door, peeked out into the hallway and proceeded past the staircase quietly towards the bathroom at the other end.  Cunningham's hands were slightly swollen, bluish; he felt as though the circulation had been cut off with rubberbands at his wrists. He intended to run warm water over his hands to revive them. He reached for the wooden handle of the bathroom door and just then heard a sound from inside. A small splash of water. Then a sniffle, like someone inside had a cold. He put his ear against the door and heard water echoing against the cracked, old tile walls. Cunningham raised his knuckles, waited a moment, then lightly rapped against the door. Four raps, then after another moment, four more slightly heavier raps. There was no acknowledgement from withinonly the same sounds of water moving and soft echoes.  \"Hello, hello?\" Cunningham whispered. \"Is someone in there?\" No response and Cunningham knocked rather forcefully this time. Because by now he was angry, he was impatient. Mostly, Cunningham felt deprived. His hands were in this severe, dangerous state, they needed attention, they needed a soaking in water, and someoneat this unbelievable hour  was inside the bathroom and would not come out, would not answer him. Cunningham was afraid to speak any louder or knock any harder, he worried he'd wake up others on the floor. And yet this sense of being invisible, being of no matter or consequence, enraged him.  He stood, frustrated and uncertain, nearly panicked for some seconds, the raincoat tight around him. He held the tingling hands close to his chest. \"Hello?\" he tried again. \"Hello, whoever is in there. I'm in pain. I'm in great pain out here in the hallway. My hands. And this is unjust.\" Cunningham lowered himself to his knees. He closed one eye, pressed his cheek and the other eye against the keyhole of the old-fashioned door. He could see a good portion of the bathroom quite clearly: the edge of the white marble sink, a wooden towel rack, a section of the medicine chest mirror. Through the keyhole, Cunningham could see the room was illuminated in a queer, dull orange that flickered and made shadow shapes against the white walls. Cunningham realised that whoever was inside there, whoever was inside ignoring him, had lit several candles.  A deeper, hollower splash startled Cunningham then, but he remained kneeling, fixed at the keyhole. First he heard the water, like glass against glass, cracking softly, breaking without violence. Then he saw the water, quick bullets that landed on the tile floor and formed tiny, clear puddles. Whoever this was was getting out of the bath; bare feet were now on the worn peach-colored rug. A handsome man stood naked before the mirror. He forced his fingers through his hair, then touched his throat, then rubbed his shoulder and chest, gazing continually at his own reflection. His hands were large with square fingers. The handsome man pressed his hands flat against his body, moved them almost in a rhythm, kneading his legs, his buttocks, pushing against the muscles in his arms, feeling his body, tensing, watching himself. The handsome man was smiling, too. Cunningham was frozen at the keyhole, compelled to watch, like a child who'd caught a bug in a jar. Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1989, enamel on wood panel, 48 x 24 x 1/2 inches Coso Foods Company Attn: To Whom It May Concern: Please pardon my handwriting. Pardon the messy ink. I am seventy years old. I have lived in this city all my life. I can remember when the trolleys still ran along Market Street. That was a long time ago.  I still live in practically the same neighborhood as when I grew up, I have only moved just up the hill a few blocks. Some nights, around sunset, I will be looking out my window and the streets will seem the way they were so long ago. The streets and signs and buildings seem like when I was a child. But, I know it is not true. So much has changed. I am writing your company to make a confession. When I was youngnot over ten or eleven years oldmy mother sent me to Teller's Market which at that time was on the corner of Post and Leavenworth Streets, just across from the building where we lived. That market and our old building have been torn down now for many years. My mother sent me with some coins to buy a jar of baked beans at Teller's for our family's supper. In those days, your products came in jars, not in cans as they do today. I pulled a jar of beans from the shelf, Coso Hearty Brick-Oven Baked Beans, which had a yellow and green label. In those days, all of your jars had those green and yellow labels.  At the counter, Mr. Teller was speaking with a neighborhood lady named Mrs. Boratch. I spotted a glass bowl with some chocolate candies and pulled out a fistful of them, five or six of these candies, and I put the candies, the coins and the jar of baked beans on the countertop. Well, Mr. Teller and Mrs. Boratch went on with their talk and they were laughing, and they did not seem to notice me at all, I was so small. Mr. Teller counted out a couple of coins for the candies and put them in his drawer. I swept the change into my hand, and then the chocolates, and stuffed all this in the pocket of my little short pants. Then I picked up that jar of baked beans. I did it without thinking. It was quick and sudden, I did not plan to steal. But, I knew Mr. Teller had not charged me for that jar. I stood there for a moment. I wondered what I should do. I wondered if I could manage to get away with it. I said good-bye to Mr. Teller and he nodded at me. I said good-bye to Mrs. Boratch, and she patted my head and said to be careful crossing Post Street. I ran home then with these chocolates and coins and the jar of baked beans which I had not paid for. This may not seem like such a terrible thing in these times. A little boy stealing a jar of beans so many years ago. No, maybe it is not. I've seen many things in my life since then. The Depression came, the wars came. In one life, so many friends will leave or die, so many lives will be ruined with pain and illness and misfortune. So many disappointments. Things you believed were good get lost somehow. I was married three times, but my marriages failed, and feelings were hurt. I did have children of my own. They did not do well for themselves at all, they did not turn out to be happy people.  So, I know there are many things I have done to feel guilt about. I have said some cruel words to people in my life, words I did not mean and could never take back. I have hurt people. I have told lies. I have told so many lies I can never begin to sort through them. Now I am afraid I will never know the truth. There was someone I thought I loved once, but I did not really feel love. There were plans I made, but I could not go on with my plans, and then I would look back and feel miserable. My life is made up of these lies, sorrows, regrets, hurts. It has come to the point now where I barely can even remember yesterday or last week. But I do remember perfectly well the new black and white tile floor of Teller's store, Mrs. Boratch's chubby red cheeks, the street lamps on Post Street, the trolleys on Market. I can remember my mother's tired face and her stained apron. In those days mothers had to stay home and take care of the children. I can remember her counting out the coins into my palm that day and telling me to run and buy a jar of beans for supper. Of all the meanness and arguments and lying in my life, it is very, very strange to me that the most haunting thing is that theft of that jar of baked beans. It has made me feel bad all these years. It has made me feel dirty. I have always been waiting, I think, to be caught. I cannot think how to really find peace with such a long, sad life as mine. I do not know a way to make amends for hurtful things I've done, or how to erase the hours and hours and years and years of my shame. So, I think the best I can do is send this letter to your company, and say how truly sorry I am that I stole. In some small fashion, I pray this will make me finally feel clean. Sincerely, Anonymous P.S. Enclosed is one dollar, which I hope will cover all costs. Thank you, and Merry Christmas. Ronald Lockett,  , 1994, enamel, barbed wire, metal on metal sheeting, 56 1/2 x 49 1/2 x 11 inches Cunningham spent the next several days distracted, unfocused, wandering as though invisible through the dead cold days of what seemed a false winter. He walked swiftly past the blond desk clerk of his hotel; in the coffee shop, he moved to a table at the rear, fixed his eyes on the newspaper, and did not look at the other patrons. Ted made trivial conversation in passinghe told Cunningham about the gym where he worked out and suggested Cunningham could use to get in shape and laughedbut Cunningham didnt reply. He was carrying around with him a shabby paperback edition of Dickens's  , but couldnt seem to concentrate on the story or the language or the ideas.  Strangely, during these days no sight or sound caught his attention, nothing seemed compelling or interesting. He didnt wonder about anything at all. He knew he was depressed, withdrawn, and yet didnt understand what caused this sadness and pain, the nature of his burden. Cunningham had the thought that he was like a character in a story, that his life was a simple, terribly sad fable.  One early evening, Cunningham stopped at an outdoor flower stand. He bought a bunch of red carnations that were chilled, nearly frozen. A fast and sudden wind chased him all the way to his hotel.  His room was too warm. The radiator beneath the window dripped onto the thin, gold carpet in a steady, soft tap, and made a dark patch there, like a bruise. Cunningham placed his flowers on the bed.  His sleep that night was uneasy. He was awakened many times but couldnt recall his dreams. His eyes burned, his ankles itched. In a room down the hall, or upstairs perhaps, a radio was playing: a man's voice, a low, sinister monotone, the words indiscernible. Cunningham was afraid. He switched on the table lamp. He kept a little pen knife in his bureau drawer, and now he brought it with him to bed, and he laid there, his hands folded over his chest, the closed knife in his fist, his eyes wide open. And then Cunningham did sleep. There was a slow, long dream of a beautiful woman playing a bugle. Her eyes shone bright green. She was smiling at Cunningham in the dream; she beckoned to him and he followed her down a path through a garden; she played a sweet melody on her horn; she laughed; she loved Cunningham. The dream ended abruptly and Cunningham woke to see his dull, fully lit room, scattered with the week's newspapers and the ruined carnations on his blanket, to hear the relentless dripping from the pipes and that radio far off. He felt silly, lying there sweating and scared and holding tight to his pathetic little knife. Cunningham sat up in bed, drew his knees close to his chest and wrapped his arms around them, lowered his head. As he cried that night, it was as though he were caught in a fast, unpredictable current of memories, quick images he could barely recognize. He coursed through treacherous flashes of his own history. After all his days of doubt, dread, secrecy and his terrible aloneness, Cunningham had arrived at this moment. While he huddled there sobbing, nearly choking, he formed a picture of his actual self: a hideous collection of deficiencies, bitter, shameful, fraudulentbut his concealments were too deep to ever heal. He was ill-formed, a moiety.  Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1990, oil, enamel, metal, branches on wood panel, 48 x 48 x 1/2 inches All people Cunningham came across, all the people in the world, seemed to have clear beliefs, to know something that Cunningham did not. Something about being happy. Cunningham was truly tortured by his breathless, tireless crying. He absolutely hated himself. In the early morning hours, before daybreak, wearing his battered tan raincoat, he trod lightly down the dim hotel corridor; it would have been unbearable to meet with any other person. This time, the bathroom door was unlocked.  Inside, Cunningham turned the taps in the bathtub. Wisps of steam rose, curled. He was surprised to see, fixed on the wooden windowsill, stubs of three candles, and there was a packet of matches with a burnt match tucked under its cover. Cunningham's hand shook as he touched a flame to the wicks. He stood at the sink, before the mirror. He regarded his own face abstractly at first, and then directly, looking into his eyes which were light brown. His eyes were the color of creamy milk chocolate. He gazed at his forehead which was narrow, but square, and at his gently arched brows; at his ears, which were small and perfectly round; at his slender, smooth throat; at his straight, thin nose; at the planes of his face, painted gold and shadowed by the candlelight.  His reddish hair had gotten a bit longer than usual, it brushed the tops of his ears and a lock curled onto his forehead. He looked finally at his mouth: the lips were slightly parted and full, they didnt seem so shapeless.  The steam, by degrees, was covering the mirror with a pearly wetness and finally his image was obscured. Cunningham removed the tan raincoat, let it fall to the tile floor. Underneath he wore flannel plaid pyjamas; he unbuttoned them slowly and took them off. Standing naked, he closed his eyes, leant his head back.  Then Cunningham let his hands drop to his sides and with his fingertips began caressing his hard, thin legs, slowly, lightly, touching himself with a nervous hesitation. He brought his hands up along his body, feeling now with the palms, studying the flat planes and warmth of this body which was never touched. He slid his hands up then to his chest, spread the fingers and stroked with unskilled, reluctant motion, his eyes still closed. He clutched at the flesh of his breast, he gently passed the edge of a thumb across the nipple, he pressed the heel of his hand hard against the bone in the center of his chest. His eyes closed tighter now, Cunningham was guided suddenly to his groin: he held the penis cupped in one hand, the scrotum in the other. He manipulated himself at first as though he were handling rare, mysterious objects, peculiar shapes that, with his eyes closed, he couldnt quite identify. And then Cunningham, his eyes shut tighter still, his brow tense, began to really feel. Sensation overwhelmed Cunningham's tragic, dangerous self-consciousness.    By this time, the water in the tub had risen nearly to the edge. Cunningham turned the taps off. He stepped into the tub, sat down quickly and stretched his legs before him. Without thinking, holding on to the sides of the tub, he slid his entire body under the water, just to his chin. The water was quite hot, too hot, perhaps.  Cunningham breathed a deep sigh. He rested his head against the tile wall and let the water wet the ends of his hair, let the water glide across and over his naked body in tiny, clear waves. A piece of plaster from the ceiling had landed in his bath and floated between his knees, under his arms, behind him, back again, and Cunningham watched its journey in the waning light from the candles.  Soon Cunningham was relaxed in a way he'd never before known: thawed out, somehow, unbended, relieved.   He was blessed to have no thoughts beyond these moments. He didnt consider the gloomy gray carpet in his office, the ominous cheerfulness of Christmas shoppers he observed day after day, the intimidating goodwill of Ted, the ordinariness of the people at the coffee shop. Through that outside, real world Cunningham could only navigate by guessing. Life wasn't so sad, really; it just wasnt joyful. And maybe life wasnt ugly; but it was not at all beautiful. It was over an hour Cunningham stayed in the tub. The bath became finally too still and tepid and so he ran a force of loud, very hot water, watched a violent downrush and bubbles and splashes. He settled back when the tub had been filled again. His skin was pinkish, soft, as though its outer layer had been gently pulled away. Abruptly, Cunningham glided deep under the water, covering his head, and then slowly emerged, all his hair shining, dark red, wet against his temples.  Through the small window light shone, signalling day, casting the room in a hazy green. Cunningham didnt rise from the bath, he didnt have a plan as to when he might. He nearly fell asleep once or twice, and then would open his eyes, see where he was, hear soft echoes, echoes of nothing but the room itself, the air and the moisture and the time he had spent here.  Cunningham never actually did say anything. He didnt whistle a tune or sing. Even his breathing was practically silent. He was stilled by this unhoped-for lifting of his despair, his guilt. Cunningham was clean.  Though speechless, Cunningham's lips shaped words, over and over. He was clean and words formed, magically illuminated to him merely through the taking of a bath. \"I am happy,\" was his silent, simple sentence. \"I am happy. I am happy. I am happy.\" End.

Ronald Lockett  (1965-1998) was slight of build and sentient to the point of grace. Lockett existed somewhat precariously in a historical crossroads between two generations, after the great mid-century social movements had ended and just before the dominance of television and urban culture. He was a unique talent, influenced equally by Thornton Dial and Bob Ross, who he watched on television. He grew up in the wilds of post-industrial Bessemer, Alabama where he lived with his mother until her death, remaining in his childhood home until his own untimely demise resulting from AIDS-related illness. He never spent more than a few weeks away from home, but was able to mine far-flung histories, both personal and shared, with deference and aplomb. ",

        "author": "Abdulrahim Hussani",
        "text": "Art by Senon Williams Senon Williams, 2022 You have a dream. You want to be a soldier when you grow up. You want to be a soldier because you want to own a gun. You want to own a gun so that you can shoot your Baba. So that you can watch him die and no one will cough. Because its a soldier. Because a soldiers job is to crack his gun and shoot. Because everyone is afraid of soldiers. Soldiers are mean, big and bad. You want to be mean, big and bad. In Anguwan Biri, when a soldier comes, everyone runs away. The boys do not tumble on the sands, their ribs naked and glistening with sweat. Quietness floods everywhere; children cringe, stuck behind their Mamas wrappers, peeping, hearts boom-booming, catching the sound of boots crushing weed. The girls cannot be seen either. They cant be seen gingerly clapping hands, singing and shaking thin waists. This is what a soldier doesinstills fear. You want to be like that. To watch people quiver. You want your Baba to quiver.  Today, your father is searching for God knows what in the sitting room. You can smell his agitation as you return from play, slipping in silently, watching him upturn and stumble past items in the sitting room. A room holding a few thingsan old Singer refrigerator, a black and white Toshiba television, pale lemon-green walls, and two cushions. Your mother stands by the kitchen door. She has a scarf wound tightly around her head the way she does when she has a headache. You fear that one day her headaches will be an unceasing affliction, given how frequently they have become. Her loose gown is as pale as the walls. But in her eyes and plum cheeks lie energy. You wonder how her face can hold so much glow despite all her hardships. For a moment, you want to believe she is happy, but her silence hangs like a dread, her hands trembling, her eyes wishing against this moment and what will follow.  Where is the money? Where is the money I left here yesterday?!  To you, your fathers voice is a thunderclap, booming, suppressing every other soundthe ear-jarring crank of the lazy ceiling fan; the voice of a seller announcing her wares at the mouth of your compound; and the drone of mosquitoes zooming away from the dark corner behind the curtain from where you watch your father raise his belt above your mother who is trembling on her knees, shouting, I dont know! I swear I dont know.  She pushes, and he staggers back, but hes upon her again in a flash. She parries his whip with her hands, and when she holds the belt and wont let go, staring him in the eyes, infuriated by her boldness, he strikes with his fist. Your Baba is of slight build, thin arms, with Jesuss face; the one in textbooks, the way your teacher describes with a twinkle in her eyes, as though Jesus were her lover. If you werent your Babas son and never witnessed what he does to your mother, you would swear that this man cannot hurt a fly. He stops beating her because his eyes have caught something among the mess from his search. You see him pick up that something. It is a wad of cash. He fixes his belt, straightens his shirt, and without a word, exits the house.  You have to kill this man. You have to save your mother. Youre not joking.  Your dream is like that of other boys who yearn to own bicycles or felele, that kind of ball made of latex with an astonishing bounce.  And if you turn a soldier and have a gun, they will teach you the trick of shooting without missing. The kind of soldier you want to become is that type who shoots without missing his target. Because when you eventually get the chance to shoot your Baba, you do not want to miss. You want to shoot him straight in the chest. You want to see his small eyes widen in astonishment. You want to see the instant sweat convulse on his brow. You want to relish the sound of his yell. How his mouth will open and say: Brahimoh, what have you done?! You want to tower above him and mock his manliness. A man, no matter how strong he is, cannot fight something as tiny as a bullet. This is fact. You have dreamt of your triumph a thousand times.  Senon Williams, 2022 The first time you talk to someone about this ambition is during class. Aunty Eliza had asked everyone about their dream profession.  Doctor! Nurse! Lawyer! Banker. . . You hear them spit out professions with the rapidity of water gushing from a hose. Your turn. You stand up and say you want to be a soldier. The class goes quiet. Nobody likes the idea. A soldier is mean, big and bad. If you become a soldier, nobody will love you. Everyone will run away.  Why? Aunty Eliza asks.  You assume she is shocked too.  I want to protect good people from bad people.  She says nothing. She only nods.  You did not lie. But you might have elaborated: I want to become a soldier so that I can have a gun and shoot my Baba. He is a bad man. My Mama is a good woman.  You imagined the kind of horror that would have crowded their faces then. Aunty Eliza would hasten to the principal. The principal would summon your Baba. And that would be the end of your dream. It was in that same class you spelt out your Babas job. You do not know what your Baba does, but you tell Aunty Eliza that he is a businessman. By the way your mates stare at you know that they have never heard of the word before. You also dont know what it means. Youd heard it on the radio and held on to it.  What business does your Baba do?  You hesitate.  , you think,  . But you say something different. The truth.  He is traveling and traveling all the time. Your Baba is mostly away than home. And when he is home, your Mama suffers. You suffer.  Sometimes, you feel like running away from this place, from the people. You always feel that everyone knows you are up to something. And in your sleep, you are always running and running and sweating from something mysterious. But you know you cannot actually run away. Not yet. Not now. What about your dream? You are yet to become a soldier, own a gun and shoot your Baba and watch him die. You cannot run away. No. Not now.  Senon Williams, 2022 The only person you tell the truth to is IjarFaru, your only friend. IjarFaru has eyes as large as oranges. They say he is a dullard because he is repeating Primary Five for the second time. You disagree. To you, he is the cleverest boy around. He knows the streets well, has a lot of friends and knows girls too. He knows how to climb trees and jump fences without sweating. He knows many things. Many things that others do not know. He alone knows how Mallam Abus dog died and who killed it. IjarFarus house is peaceful. You know this because, IjarFaru, whose mouth is like that of a parrot, never says anything like his Baba is bad. For this and much more, you envy him.  The day you tell him your secret ambition, the sun is burning fiercely in the sky. You both are on the sand, tugging, panting and groaning. Your bodies are tacky with dust and sweat. When you grow spent, you both lie on your backs, the sun scorching your eyes.  IjarFaru?  Ennh?  I want to kill my Baba, you say with the ease of munching gburugburu.  After some seconds silence, IjarFaru bursts into laughter. You both sit up. He sees the seriousness in your eyes.  I want to be a soldier so that I can own a gun and shoot him.  He looks around and speaks in a whisper as though he is afraid that someone may overhear the secret he is about to share with you.  Why? Is your Baba bad?  Wallahi! He is worse than a soldier.  But if you become a soldier, everyone will run away. I will not be your friend anymore.  I will not be as bad as other soldiers. I shall protect you. You just have to point out a person and I will deal with him, you say, feeling a surge of enthusiasm.  He chuckles, finding humor in the idea of you protecting him.  To be a soldier will take a very long time fah. And you have to know big, big, people in big, big towns.  You frown. Something tells you that he does not like the idea of you aspiring to be a soldier and wants to persuade you out of it. But you believe that IjarFaru has a solution to everything.  His eyes dart here and there again. He whispers, You know Takwali?  Who is Takwali?  Takwali, the area boy.  Ehem?  If you become Takwalis boy, hell get you a gun. He may even help you kill your Baba.  This thing did not enter your insides. Takwali is a tall, menacing brute with coal-red eyes who always goes about with a giant gora. People fear the troublesome rascal. Takwali is strong. People say that he can even disappear, as in vanish into thin air. Senon Williams, 2022 IjarFaru once told you this:  You remember that night after Ramadan when some boys entered Baba Ikilimas house? Takwali led them. He did a very bad thing to Ikilima and shot her Baba in the leg.  You remember that episode very well. But you dont know the hoodlums who broke into Baba Ikilimas house or what transpired there. All you know aside from that incident is that you woke up one morning and saw that Baba Ikilima had loaded a trailer with all his belongings and left Ungwar Biri with his family. Sometimes you wonder how IjaFaru gets his information. So you despise his idea of joining Takwalis gang. Takwali wears no uniform or heavy boots and does not show his gun in public like soldiers do. Soldiers are looking for Takwali. He is on the run and hiding. You do not want to be running and living like a rat. You do not want to be drinking sholi and tramadol dissolved in Benylin. You do not want to be evil and mad. Killing your Baba will have to wait because you must first become a soldier and own a clean gun which you can show in public. So that when you shoot him, you wont have to run and hide like Takwali. Allah ya kiyaye! you mutter.  Takwali is strong and you can attest to this because you have seen him fight, three against one, a fight that is still fresh in your memory. It had happened right in the heart of your small street, Layin Kosei. So named after Hajiya Larai, the old woman who has fried kosei every morning and evening for close to twenty years. It was on a fresh-eyed Saturday morning. The boys who attacked him three of themalso mean lookingwere riding a kabu kabu when they suddenly crossed paths with Takwali, all by himself. They quickly disembarked from their motorcycle and faced their opponent, gritting their teeth out of hellish hatred. Takwali did not run. You had thought that foolish. People hung close to their doors, peeping, hearts racing, waiting for this spectacle to unfold. Takwali stared at his assailants long and hard with no fear in his eyes as he gripped his gora. Even if he were afraid, he made a good job of concealing it. He yelled insults at them, taunting and urging them on.  Ku shigo mana in kun chika!  The boys also yelled. Each boy held his own gora. Collectively, they did not look afraid. Area boys, no matter how obviously weak they seem, dont have the luxury of displaying fear.  You watched as one among Takwalis opponents, a bald one, ripped off his shirt with the ease of tearing paper, and flaunted his well-formed muscles in the prodigious sunlight. You saw the sweat on three boys faces as they circled Takwali, and you saw the devilish smile on Takwalis face and told yourself that he was mad. His unwillingness to be intimidated shocked you. Three against one? How would he survive? Mad indeed. Because no one would help him. Only soldiers and the police will intervene in a skirmish involving hoodlums. Sirens bring a quick end to battles. Spectators disappear as fast as they can. Otherwise, such skirmishes end when one side loses.  The well-built bald one who had ripped his shirt rushed toward Takwali, but the latter was as alert as a cat. His gora swirled and landed fiercely. Just one hit and the bald mans skull cracked open. Made more crimson by daylight, blood poured eagerly from the mans head where he lay lifeless, subdued. The onlookers released audible gasps. Takwalis gora is not ordinary. The remaining two men looked flustered but were not ready to concede defeat. One of them drew out a long wuka and tried to pierce his enemy. The blade bent agonizingly against Takwalis skin the way a nail scratches the surface of a concrete wall. No doubt, Takwali had eaten maganin karfe. He was well fortified. No blade made of steel could pierce him. His two assailants, seeing the impossibility of their mission, knowing fully well that they could not defeat him, jumped on their kabu kabu and sped away as fast as they could. A short time later, the police arrived and took away the corpse of the bald man. They banged on doors, asked questions, and made threats, but nobody said anything or seemed to know anything.  Senon Williams, 2022 You are sitting close to the old stove and watching the lazy flames crawl eagerly around the black pot. Your Mama is humming a song. Last night, in your sleep, the noises came. You do not know how to tell her that you are not usually a dead log on nights when such things happen. You fear her temper, more than anything else. Mama pours garri into the boiling water. You see the grains being absorbed greedily by the water until there is no space left in its stomach. You are going to eat eba and okra soup. You do not like this meal because you have been eating it for a couple of days now and because the okra soup is always so watery and tasteless. But you do not complain. You have learnt not to complain. The only option is hunger. Suddenly you think of Muntaka, another one of your good friends. If you are fortunate enough, you will find something to eat at his place. You decide to hurry.  You begin to eat. Mama pauses and looks at you. You are not happy. What is wrong? You look up at her. The way she stares at you makes you feel naked. You look down at the bowl of eba, at a loss of what to say.  Tell me, Ibro, she says.  I hate Baba. I know everything that happens. I wish he would just go away and never return. I wish he would just die.  You see shock course through Mama's veins. She drops the ball of eba adorned with slimy soup and stares at you. Instinctively, she picks up the ball of eba and dips it into the soup bowl. You watch her closely.  Get me drinking water.   You spring up from your chair. A few moments later, you return, cup in hand, already aware of your Mamas antics. It is not the water she wants. You feel her fingers bypass the cup and reach for your hand. You slip away from her shallow grasp. The cup crashes to the ground, spilling water across the floor. Before she can stop you, you are standing by the door, panting, waiting to flee into the world.  The day Ill hear you speak ill about your Baba again, wallahi, that day will be the day Ill finally break your big head.\"   You do not remember how you walked to Muntakas house. You are still hungry when Muntakas mother places before you an enticing bowl of amala and rich, pepperish, ewedu soup; you do not even care to wash your hands before you begin eating. Muntaka is not home. You wait for him until you grow bored. You thank his Mama and leave. In the street, you whistle a song to yourself despite the anger you are feeling. You kick small stones into malaria- and cholera-nestling gutters filled with filth. You watch boys your age play golf with sticks and a disc crudely cut out from worn flip-flops. You keep wondering why Mama would defend Baba after all the evil things he has done and keeps doing. Senon Williams, 2021 There are days when your Baba is a bit like the man in your fantasies, although such days have become so increasingly rare with the passage of time. On such days, he comes back early from his mysterious forays. Even before the sun dies. He will sit on the verandah, staring at the busy road and the shaggy grass which no one cares to tame. He will call you and order you to sit on his lap. Then he will proceed to sing strange songs whose wordings you cannot place. Always like he is singing in a foreign language. You hate such moments. But why? Maybe it is his raucous voice that you do not like, his voice sounding like a small bird with a giant ant stuck in its throat. No singers voice. Or perhaps, the hatred you have slowly developed for him makes you despise his singing skills. He always grows tired of your silence and lack of response. Freed from your bondage, he will continue to stare at the busy road, the honking of impatient cars and kekes, the singsong bustle of hawkers, and the plateau of shaggy grass a few feet away that no one cares to tame. Sometimes, you gaze at your Baba the way one gazes at a stranger. He is a stranger. This man, you do not know him. You do not know him the way a little boy is supposed to be proud and familiar with his Baba. Senon Williams, 2022 You did get a gun. Not from being a soldier. Not from Takwali. But from your Baba. You find it beneath his bed. In the backyard, you show it to IjarFaru. You have never seen fear in his eyes before.  That thing. That small thing that comes out of it and hits a person, taking him down, pouring blood, are you sure it is inside? he asks, quivering.  I dont know.  How will you know?  I dont know.  What will you do?  Senon Williams, 2022 And your chance comes. You will never forget that nightcold and dark. Your Babas growl. Your Mama clinging on to her silence but now and then uttering something like a plea. Then you hear her wail, and anger floods you inside. An anger that rattles the frame of your small body. You swallow hard and reach for the gun where you had hidden it beneath a pile of clothes. Quietly, you creak open the door to their room. But how can one aim accurately in the dark? You are not thinking. You aim at what resembles the looming shadow of the beast.   But you suddenly decide to turn on the switch. Your father looks flummoxed. Both assailant and victim turn towards you. It is your time of glory as your father gawks at the gun pointed at him. He is not used to this scene: being at the mercy of another. Your mother begs you to drop the weapon. And her voice does something to your unwavering resolve. For the first time since you began harboring this dream, fear creeps inside your heart and lingers. The magnitude of what you are about to do hits you hard, as though you have never thought about what it means to kill another human. Your hand begins to tremble, and sweat builds an ocean on your face. You hear the voice of the man you hate, urging you to pull the trigger. You hear the mockery in his voice as he kicks your mother one last time as though he is goading you, telling you that you can do nothing to save her; not even you wielding a gun will stop him. He strides towards you, yanks the weapon away from your slack grip, and strikes you down with a slap.  Weaklings, he sneers as he walks out.

        "text": "Art by Nazanin Noroozi Nazanin Noroozi,  . 2022.  Image transfer, acrylic, color pencil and lithograph print mounted on mat board. 20 x 24 inches.  When you are a refugee from Iran, its hard to say who in the culture consciousness one can relate to. Very few share your story. And those who at least somewhat dosay Googoosh, say Christiane Amanpourthey somehow dont quite either. (Looking for genuine connection with the very rich and famous is always a losing battle.) Much of your life becomes made up of the quest to find someone whose circumstances might   relatable. For me, this person was an unlikely one: an Iranian eccentric my fathers age whose story has never stopped haunting me since I heard it. Mehran Karimi Nasseri, or as he liked to be called Sir Alfred Mehran, died this past November. He was most known as the man who spent eighteen years living in a terminal of Charles de Gaulle airport. Born in 1945 in Khuzestan, much of his life was caught up in the bureaucracies that got in the way of simple rights like reconnecting with family, how he ended up at his airport residency in the first place. His documents were always deemed offwhether from Belgium, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, France, and by the time they were legitimatized he no longer wanted to leave his own personal limbo. The airport was quite simply home. He was given refugee status in France ultimately in 1999 but he stayed at the airport til 2006, when he had to leave due to illness. He lived in hostels as well, and had only in recent months returned to the airport when he suddenly died of a heart attack, with several thousand euros in hand. (Airport spokespeople have been quoted explaining that he returned to live as a homeless person in the public area of the airport since mid-September, after a stay in a nursing home. They mentioned the whole airport community was attached to him, and our staff looked after him as much as possible during many years, even if we would have preferred him to find a real shelter.) He was an icon and legend, as invisible as he was visible. He would spend his days journaling and reading newspapers, while even the people who did know would pretend they did not know. But he was no secret: Steven Spielberg made a movie,  , based on his life, and countless journalists made pilgrimages just to interview him. He was, as they say, a fixture until suddenly in this dynamic year, he was not.  Nazanin Noroozi, from the series  ,  2023.  Copper plate etching on abaca and cotton sheet. triptych 18'' x 54'' overall. Each panel 18'' x 24'' Its hard to know what he might have made of this years revolution in Iran. After all, he seemed to be suffering varying states of mental deterioration which would often manifest in delusion. He alleged that he was expelled from Iran in 1977 due to participating in anti-Shah protests (there were no records of this). He also claimed his mother was Anglo European and he no longer identified as Iranianat one point, since documents did not declare him Sir Alfred or British he did not sign residency papersbut again all evidence refuted this narrative. In November, of course, so much was going on for Iranians all over the world. I saw few Iranians note this legends passing. I realized not many Iranians knew what to make of him. Was he embarrassing to them? His story too sad? Or too baffling? Even infuriating? But that all sounded distinctly Iranian to me. His loss wounded me though. I think what made me feel this bizarre connection to him was his embodiment of our collective placelessness. Years ago I confessed to a partner how I felt most at home in airports and in airplanesbecause I wasnt anywhere. I was just in some in-between purgatory that made me feel most me. There was no tether to a mother country that had long forgotten me or the anchor to the new land that struggled to claim me. I recalled how as a child I loved road trips and train travel for the same reasonthe problems really only seemed to exist in the before and after. Nasseri to me seemed to be living incredibly honestlywhy tie himself to a land when the truth was he had none anymore and could never quite in his lifetime. Why commit to a place, why seek roots, why go back or commit forward, where there was an actual place that could address his condition. He could be forever in a place of transit, where the cast was ever-evolving, where the responsibilities and banalities and demands of daily life could altogether evade you. Nasseri wanted to live in the confines of an absolute nowhere ultimately. And he was willing to live that very literally. All he had to lose was his mind really. The last six months have been beyond destabilizing for almost every Iranian I know. Losing our minds has been on the table daily, it feels like, as we read about unparalleled courage of activists and unending slaughter of the same populationoften teenagers and other young adultsplus a roller coaster of good and bad news that swings from hope to hopelessness without warning. Its never felt quite like this, even if we have sort of been here before. In 2011, I edited  s first and only Iranian-American issue, after the Green Movement which to us seemed full of hope even if felt short of our collective promise. Now we are here again, the same struggle and battle, and victories that feel as traumatizing as their opposites. In choosing the cast for this special issue, I wanted a diversity of perspective, background, culture, emotion. As a result we have a tremendous amount of talent that dares to answer those questions Nasseri refused. They announce themselves with clarity, candor, courage, and lovethey are taking the space that we can no longer afford to push aside. Whether it is the radical candyscapes of Taravat Talepasand, Hushi Mortezaies iconic rock-n-roll-meets-queer-dream aesthetics, Sunny Shokraes diasporic visual poetry from her Chapter Series, Lili Gs potent protest art. There is Gary Gach and Erfan Mojibs oracular Hafez translation that expounds on tyranny and time, Hamed Kashani and Gary Gachs translation of Bijan Jalalis bittersweet ode to myth, and Gary Gachs translation of Alireza Roshans heartbreaking portrait of women unmothered in these cycles of revolution. Identity is elastic, especially in the gender tightrope reflections of Danny Rafinejad, and Nina Mirs channeling of a Prophet Nina in confronting an Iran that might never accept a transfemme identity, and Masi Abolhassans trans subjects finding refugee life treacherous outside as much as inside Iran. We have Homa Dashtakis Zoroastrian ruminations, and Mohammed Hakimas meditations on theocracy and oneness, and Niloufar Talebis longing for homeland while on a Georgian Fulbright, plus Ava Homas call for intersectionality from a Kurdish perspective. We also have Golafarin Razis triptych of Persian sayings deconstructed, Zara Houshmands candid reflections on the hurdles of translation in poetry form, Marjan Kamalis Saddam-busting-youth from a section that got cut from her acclaimed novel  , and Neda Semnanis playground identity short. And then there is of course my piece of fiction (our publisher insisted I submit!) on a woman being involved in a fictional Iran issue that turns quickly nightmarish.  We hope that all these pieces can provide that kaleidoscopic vision to a new wave of movement that has no real beginning or enda revolution whose greatest advantage is its deeply diverse, multifaceted, uncatalogable, insistently divisible, beautifully unique moving parts.

The glint of marketed images, ideas of freedom, democracy, the big myth of history where one  plunges into pre- consciousness, deeper: betrayal and breakdown, longing and defeat, the vein of knowing or  not-knowing. A homespun pride  raises the rust, a bravado where no one gets what was so idly stated the blinders that hold one from fear, the assimilations of hodgepodge, the yielding, the withheld, the water- rounded edges of the mind where flux is the master, conventions rearranged in order  of appearance. Time weighs inward in encounters with the divine, the ever-looking- over-the-shoulder for that space between for the paradoxes, for that shadow  within light.

A speech resumes no, a stern lecture of a kingdom once had, the homicidal falling at the feet and the eyes all alleys, all in your twenties. Hackneyed, perhaps perhaps hand-on-heart  fleeting. Anne-Marie Creamer,  , 2019, digital drawing, 29.7 x 42 cm Lies down on the curbside, pulling weeds. Where are the snails? she says, or the raven? Too good to number these things, they may Have slipped between two thieves!  She had searched prudence, she had walked Into the night following her cuticles. I shall navigate the great circle, she says.  An ocean of unimaginable secrets, she says.  As if upon a window smiling. Anne-Marie Creamer,  , 2019, digital drawing, 29.7 x 42 cm Mother of gods, imagine yourself as an explanation, raised on the wall, a carved star shimmering through glass in a blazing trail of epiphanies a dominion as tall as a cloud, like nothing else, a breath-full of beautiful thoughts of sorrow and dread. Anne-Marie Creamer,  , 2019, digital drawing, 29.7 x 42 cm Boldly, in that rumbling bottomness, a tender filigree attune to the unison of mothers and daughters, a sound of bubbling felicity as the grand curtain rises. A second, similar counterpart thats been carried over, four voices out of the storm naming a few things for themselves, those buzzards circling the carrion, the broad-handed undertaker clucking, clicking his tongue. Look at the lavender curls! The bodies quivering like mercurial fluid, moving toward those overgrown hands and the flickering of the candle on the nightstand: everything made visible, again. Anne-Marie Creamer,  , 2019, digital drawing, 29.7 x 42 cm  The world is intertwined  with the unworld.  A true apprentice comes  but once in an eclipse: the measureless inconsistencies,  the choking estuaries,  the mind of an unbeing undoes all  that has come before   What a glorious  river picture! What is the inference turning? she asked bending over  to pluck a flower.  Such a puny recipe.  The acts those limbs themselves make.  We see it as our machine, the acts like thefts from human logic the surface of the mind enscrolled,  never spoken in good company. An illumination,  a clear sky  or cool breeze. Dont waste your breath  collecting conch shells,  know you have all possible  foreknowledge of the enigma,  the engine of the poetry,  in good faith, or the pest  that has marked us,  the profile of the mountain,  that inner-surpassed  tendency to fight. Hold up the mirror.  Know you have  all possible forms from the eagle to the bear,  from the sprouting spruce  to the monkey puzzle tree to hold you up. And if,  in some strange fashion,  the pressure of the eyes,  the leisure of the face,  the pummel of the sword,  all become one thing;  walk away with frost  on your coat, I say. The sound of the spiders webs,  the creaking of the tiny eyes,  even those kept in bottles  at the center of the city  where everyone has been trained  in the art of life; the unfolding  of those miniscule creatures,  the buzz and hum  at the center of gravity, perturbs   In the storm the earth worships the sky,  in the flurry, the urge for second life for an  instrumental, elemental fire to survive.  Turn old kisses to new ones,  like sparks of carbon, all genders  fetching toward the cornucopic  curves of paradise. Break the spell. Unword the world.  All this nonsense about an earthly paradise.  The world remade in my image and all that the fire within the eye or the eye within the fire.  What is known is never written.  Burn it into the Great Appearance.  Walk along, mingle.

        "text": "Art by Giancarlo Calamo LaGuerta                       Titilope Sonuga I have told this story many times, starting with Chinedus story, but that was not my first memory. My earliest memoryand by this, I mean the earliest that I rememberwas of Justice Leagues Superman, Clark Kent.  Born in the early 2000s in a typical privileged Nigerian home, childhood in the evenings was sitting on the sofa with your older siblings, legs crossed, gaze fixed on the hunchback TV mounted on the etager TV stand, eating chips and drinking juice, while watching Justice Leagues Superman on Silverbird TV station.  Superman, the famous fictitious character whose alter ego was Clark Kent, saved the world from evil people. I liked watching Superman. I wanted to clasp his hands and fly with him. I wanted him to save me, although unsure of what I needed salvation from. Whenever watching him, new feelings trickled through my body. I often used my mothers hollandaise wrapper to form a cape, jumping through our dining table, windows, and staircases, fantasizing about Superman by my side, jumping with me, whispering: I will save you, Chinonso. One day I chipped my front tooth when I jumped from the dining table. I was five and a half years old.  Chinedu joined my grade three class. It was on a drizzling Wednesday after sports. We shuffled into the classroom earlier than usual because of the drizzle. He was already seated in the first column on the second row. A boy my height, dark-skinned like me, with a lasting smile on his face.  There was an elegant reserve added to the way he did things. His handwriting was a neat, beautiful slope. He wore a zesty fragrance. He sang Ave Maria, regulating the Latin with his smooth treble during the religious studies class. His manner of speaking with a polished British inflection made the class question his identity even though he was a Nigerian and had an Igbo name.  I stuttered whenever we talked to each other. He was not gauche, but I was. I would always deflect my gaze from him when we spoke, even though I liked talking to him.  I thought of Chinedu often. In class. At home. I dreamt about him many times. In one of my dreams, he was the twin brother my parents left in the hospital when we were born. In another, we wore capes, held our hands, and jumped around the playground at school.  As a child, I was irritated by many things, but in one incident I recall, Chinedu was speaking to me, and a drool flew from his mouth into my mouth; I swallowed it by mistake. I could have flinched, I could have loathed him, but I was indifferent. The spittle had come from Chinedus mouth, tongue. It was Chinedu. No one else.  I could sense that something about me was distinct, but it wasnt yet a concern. The boys and girls in the class felt for each other what I felt for Chinedu.  One day in class, while we were jotting down what the teacher wrote on the board, I sighted what seemed to be an error. I dont quite remember how the words were put, but it read like this:  . I, young and bright, called for the teachers attention and told her she was supposed to write home sexual activities and not homosexual activities. The word appeared wrong. Frustrated by my precociousness and zeal to rebel, the teacher said it was no mistake. I, still headstrong about the incorrectness of the word, took heed.  After school, I picked up the bulky dictionary from the eight-column shelf in the sitting room, and I swirled through the pages, searching for the letter H. When I found the page, I adjusted my glasses to my nose bridge, anxious and squeezed with the urge to prove my teacher wrong. I saw the word. I froze. She was correct. I gawked at the word. Not only did I feel defeated by my teacher, I saw myself in that word. I thought of what I felt for Chinedu. Then the first statement I mumbled was: am I... a homosexual?  I was eight years old.  On a Sunday morning in the childrens church, the teacher, a stubby woman who wielded a supercilious air, spoke about the destructive lifestyles that Christians should not partake in. She opened the Bible before her, paused, adjusted her eyes on us, and began to speak. Her voice was a reverberation threatening to drench any sound that came close. She read Genesis chapter nineteen, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, how God flung sulfur on the city and smoldered the dwellers because of their lifestyle.  Whenever her eyes met mine as she spoke, my chest braced taut, my breathing hard.  The words were repetitive, boisterous in my head:  . Those words, her words, were folded inside my mind, hemmed with strings of fear. I would be disgraced. A large screen depicting my actions and impressions would be shown for everyone to see. God would hurl sulfur at me. I would be scorched in the lake of fire. The devil would insert his hot rod inside me. My eyeballs would fall out. My intestines would burst. I would forever be condemned. Because I loved Chinedu, because I loved Clark Kent, and because I loved our kind.  I was eight, saddled by these sermons. I abhorred sleep because my dreams frightened me. One of the nightmares I can remember was of Ogres, about half a dozen, holding large forks, haunting me because it was judgment day.  I would wake up with panting, sweat pouring down my face, unable to cry out because I knew my parents would chastise me if I told them the reason.  Every day, I thought about the sermons, about hellfire. Trepidation, like a buried seed, was burgeoning inside me.  I would loathe church revivals because of the way the pastor would call people out:    I was terrified, terrified that I would one day be disgraced.  I was swaying my hips to the rhythm of Bricks and Laces Love Is Wicked floating through the stereo in the sitting room when my mother walked in and said, So you want to be living this gay lifestyle? Why are you shaking your waist like a homosexual?  A sharp coldness hit the deepest cells of my being. My mother had said the word. Homosexual. She would say it often whenever my effeminacy affronted her.  I attended a military secondary school where I was derided for my effeminacy and often called gay. Whenever I was called gay, I would defend myself and swear on my life, howling. How dare you call me gay? Me gay? God forbid. Despite my protests, a boy in the class opposite mine promised to kill me if I did not stop behaving like a homosexual. He was huge and had heavy cheeks that dropped like a bulldogs. It was new, the taunting. Even though I had gotten subtle barbs before then, no one had threatened to beat or kill me. I went to a Catholic-British primary school; we were, in Nigerian speak, Ajebuttersbourgeois kids. No one noticed my effeminacy, or rather, it did not matter.  Senior J was a benevolent senior. While others were aggressive and chaotic, he was warm and humane. He came to our class block often, gave us advice, and told us stories. Senior J was pudgy, dark-toned, with sallow, uneven teeth. He had a problem with the way I was and said I needed someone to put me through, said that I should see him the next day in his class after school. I was not sure what he meant, so I did not read much into his words. Only ten or eleven years old, I was naive.  The next morning, I found Senior J lying flat in the middle of the assembly ground, his face to the dirt. Everyone huddled, whispering to each other, and gawking at him.  What did he do? I thought.  Our commandant spoke with rage and said Senior J had sexually assaulted a boy in Form One. The commandant ordered every junior student who had talked to him to come forward. Many people came forward. I came forward, too. In the days following, rumors spread that I was the boy who Senior J had sexually assaulted. I heard people say it. Some people walked up to me to say sorry. I was not the boy. His identity was confidential. But it was weird. For some reason, I started thinking that I was the boy. Why were they apologizing to me? Why were they talking about me?  After I asked, a classmate told me that it was because I looked like a homosexual, and I was the only one in Form One that this kind of thing could happen to.  I went home and cried, but I could not tell my parents what had happened because I did not want them to know.  was a popular Hindi soap that aired on Zee World. It followed Yash, a wealthy widower with two daughters, who married Aarti, a divorce with a son from her previous marriage. Both individuals faced many ups and downs in their second endeavor to embark on the marital journey. Yash had perfectly etched brows, was full-bearded, quiet, and had a sense of agency. I liked Yash. When the girls talked about the soap, and how they, too, liked Yash, I would always want to blurt that I loved Yash, but I held it in, could not say it out loud. With my mothers phone, I checked his profile on the internet and saved all the pictures of him that I could find. Every day, I stared at his picture, longing for his embrace.  But I would go to hell for liking Yash. I would be burned. I remember crashing on my knees in my room, begging God to forgive me, crying, pleading that I would never love Yash or any man again.  And I would love Senior A, the new head boy when we were in Form Two. He was tall and brilliant and won many awards in competitions. Whenever he walked past our block, Id stare out of the window, gaping at him, my jaws unlocked.  I told God, one last time. Just let me love Senior A. Please. It was that same year, at age twelve, that I started writing to God at the end of each year.  In my family, it was a ritual to put down our prayer points and wishes on the last day of December. I would scribble a petition about not wanting to love boys and men again, and then burn it with a fire lighter. This would go on for a long while. Homophobia cloaks itself as a concern, but it is inherently hate.  My classmates had planned, when we were in Form Three, to set me up with a girl since I had no girlfriend. I overheard them talking about it, saying, We just hope that Chinonso is not gay. The girl was buxom, her voice commanding. She made me think of Goliath whenever she sauntered toward me with her gigantic stride. The girl, intimidating, would always caress me to see if she could turn me on, and I could not refuse. During tea breaks, she would push my food away and run her hands over my chest, sometimes touching my lips. In the visual arts studio, she would brush her backside against my trousers. One day, I begged her to leave me alone, told her that I had a girlfriend, Mirabel, at home. She left me alone. My classmates left me alone.  I watched an online deliverance service on a TV station owned by a popular pastor. He delivered a boy from homosexuality and said that demons had slept with the boy and made him that way.  I cannot quite remember what it was called, but a place-your-palm-on-the-TV-screen deliverance session occurred. I placed my palm on the TV screen, saying amen to the pastors Be Delivered!, hoping that I would be delivered. I would perform this action many times, even though it was all in vain, my efforts futile.  After I received my first phone, I quickly filled my search history with how to not love a man as a man and how to be freed from homosexuality. I watched videos on YouTube about the same topics, most of them disappointing. I recall one where a man accepted himself after years of denial. I was disgruntled. That was not what I wanted. While everyone had lovers in senior school, I didnt. I immersed myself in academics and literature, my studies the only way to detract peoples attention from me. Everyone saw me as a guru who was not interested in dating or sex. But I wanted to be loved, although not in the way they wanted.  Slurs still came. The teacher who said that my classmates should pray for me so that I wouldnt love men because it was my kind that did that immoral act. The boys who shamed me for refusing a lap dance from the girl with the biggest backside. The girl who shouted my name in the biology class when the teacher said homosexual people wore diapers because they had leaking butts. Everyone laughed at me. Tired of the insults that night I filled the bathtub with water, and I doused myself inside. As the water permeated through my nose and my mouth, I thought of all the things I would lose if I died. I ran out of the bathtub, coughing. All through the night, I shivered under my blanket. The next morning, I woke up with excruciating pangs in my ribs. I came up with plans. Pretending to like basketball and paying a huge amount to get in the club; drinking gin and chewing ice blocks to morph my voice into a coarse baritone; leaving the school choir; changing my gait; planning a fake relationship with E.  E was in her first year in senior secondary school; I was in my second. E was brilliant. I first knew E in the school choir. She came to audition, and her voice was a mellifluous alto. We became friends when I complimented her voice. She was slim, a little taller than me, had plump lips; sport waves spread over her low-cut hair. I wanted to love her, tried hard to love her in the way I loved Chinedu. Still, nothing. Whenever we talked, I would stare into her eyes to see if I would entice myself; it was sterile.  I told her that I wanted us to be more than friends, something undefined. We should tell people that we were lovers. She agreed. But what we had was not more than a friendship. No racing pulse, no fluttering in my stomach, no tingling in my nerve endings, no rhythm.  They called her Nonsos babe. I liked the name. It magnified my essence. Schoolmates, especially the boys, began to laud me. Now they saw me as a real man. A straight man.  It would go on, the semblance, the love for boys and men, the prayers, the blurred hallelujahs, the exorcism. The year I graduated from secondary school, I applied to the law program at the university, but I was a few points below the admission cutoff point, so I was given another major. Because I wanted to study law, I rejected the major. I stayed back home (until I got admission the next year to study law). I wanted to be taken seriously, even though, truth to tell, all I really wanted to do was read and write.  I drowned myself in books. My father got me a laptop. I took my writing seriously. I opened an Instagram account, and I tried to date girls online. I kept praying my attractions away. I kept loving my kind.  I clung to my faith and got more involved in the church.  When I thought that terror had run down a bit, it rose, fierce, disrupting me. One of the Sunday school teachers called men who loved men Reprobate and Renegade. She said that they were destined for hell, that God had written it down.    I stopped going to church, even though I still clung to God. In 2020, the coronavirus pandemic changed the world; revamped my life. It was the year of unearthing, of acceptance. I faced my fears. I did not know until then that many people like me, homosexuals, queers, existed. One day I was scrolling through my Explore page on Instagram when a page popped up: a young black man clutching a small placard that read QUEER LIVES MATTER. He was Nigerian. An Igbo person. We shared similar characteristics, identities. According to his profile, he was an educator on gay rights; he created video content about queer culture, parlances, and human rights on his page. I was startled by his audacity. Gay. Young. Nigerian. Igbo.  Every day during that period, I watched his educational videos. I learned new terminologies like heteronormativity, cisgender, genderqueer, drag, ze/hir pronouns, cis heteropatriarchy. I learned about the umbrella of sexualities and the fluidity of sexualities, about the incident at the Stonewall Inn on the 27th day of June 1969 that birthed the queer pride month, where the police raided the club and arrested thirteen persons for gender-inappropriate clothing, and how the queers revolted.  I admired him, but not in a romantic way, instead in the I-wish-I-could-be-like-you way. He loved himself and cherished his body, and, because of how he loved himself, I, too, began to love myself. The inward resentment I had for myself began to wither.  One of my friends shared a video of the gay Igbo man on his Instagram story. I asked him if he knew the man, and he said yes, that he was a fan, too. A fan? I thought to myself. Was my friend also gay?  After days of mental gymnastics, I was finally able to ask him if he was straight. And when I did, he said he wasnt. Said he knew that I wasnt, either.  I was too stunned to say anything. For the first time in my life, I felt a certain kind of shared immediacy for this misery that was my sexuality.  He shared his story, told me to take it easy with myself, and sent me books from the Apple Books app to read. We were bound by strands of solace.  Like a raisin in the sun, the self-resentment shriveled. One morning, I had just finished reading one of the recommendations my friend sent in, Frankie Edoziens  , written by a Nigerian gay man. It was bold. Unflinchingly truthful. It spilled secrets. At first, the puritan in me kept cringing when the men in the book had furtive sex. I felt naked, ashamed. At some point, I asked myself, How can he say this out loud? So, this happens in Nigeria? Are these people real?  I saw the horrendous realities that queer people in Nigeria faced. I saw them shapeshifting to conventions, wearing off their skins. I saw the beauty of queerness thriving amid chaos. I saw resistance.  I suddenly felt light. Too light. As though I could glide in the air and fly with Superman if I jumped off my balcony. This was what it meant to be free. To feel light, beautifully empty, expunged of all your disdain. I was free. Yes, I loved my kind. Even though the world was on a lockdown, I made new friends. Friends like me. All on Instagram. Wooers, too. Good and awful. On the phone I told a straight friend about my sexuality. Told her that I was bisexual; I didnt want to tell her I was gay. I knew she would reject me. It took me some weeks to come to fully trust her. Once I did, I told her that I was gay, and she told me it was fine. That she knew. We cried together. Days later, she sent me photos of half-naked men and bodybuilders and asked me if I liked them. She may have meant well, but to me, her actions were problematic. She never asked me about love. And her questions were tinged with ghastly curiosities and hyper-sexualization: The questions offended me. I had never had sex. Of course, I was (am) a sexual being. But love entails more than sex. I confronted her, and she said, I was kind enough to accept you, even though this gay thing is bullshit.  We never spoke again.  Recently, I read Otosirieze Obi-Youngs short story You Sing of a Longing, a story about a queer man, who, amongst other things, falls in love. Reading the story, I felt seen. I will always remember these words from the story: The words have stayed with me. I, a hopeless romantic, loves love. I want to explain to my friend, to the world, to God, that this is what it feels like for me to be in love with a man.  Obi-Youngs story inspired me to write my own. One afternoon, I was setting my clothes inside the washing machine when the Lagoon Front story idea came to me. It was initially a piece about a gay teen who suffered from depression because he was being bullied. However, I was scared to write that story because I feared backlash from my parents and my straight friends. So I made the narrative about an effeminate boy since it is possible to be effeminate but straight. In late 2020, I met F on Instagram. He did not look loud. He was also handsome, reminding me of Chinedu. F had calm eyes, tender beards, and a benign smile. After I announced I was going on hiatus from Instagram, we began talking on WhatsApp every day. I felt flutters in my belly when he spoke. He read my stories. He lauded and critiqued them. We liked many of the same things, and even more, our differences, our diversities, were beautiful. He was shrewd and had an eye for details. I liked everything about him.  I could hear voices in my head during that period. One of the voices, similar to the Sunday school teachers, kept calling me a reprobate evildoer whenever I smiled at Fs text messages or his voice from the phone. One of the voices kept saying F would let me down. One of the voices kept saying I would die for loving F. One of the voices, although silent and fleeting, kept saying that I should let life be, that I should make peace with myself, that I deserved love. But the other voices quelled this voice.  I ghosted him. I did not reply to his messages, did not pick up his calls. But I still loved him. Months later, when I texted him, he had gotten a girlfriend. I was afraid to love because I was afraid of dying. To love is to die. You are not sure if the person you entrusted your heart with will mince it or keep it safe. So I kept inside my shell, reading and writing, not caring too much for love even when my soul yearned.  I continued to carry on conversations online, sometimes with other men. My toxic trait dismissed them even though I loved them. Then I met this tech guy. He was quite older than me, had nice poses, read books. I liked him and he liked me. Like F, he read my stories. We decided to meet; I told him I wanted an open place, and that I was a shy person. He said hed make me comfortable.  He looked better in real life than he did online. He drove a silver-hued Toyota Corolla. Sitting next to him talking in the car, he caressed my thighs and almost reached for my groin. I froze. I had told him that sexual intimacy would come later since I was not sure about trusting temporary people with my body. At that point, I did not know if our shared affection was only transient. He kept stroking my thighs, his tough palm causing hotness on my thighs. I remained still, could not say no, did not say no. After some time, I finally blurted out No! Then I exited his car, went home, and cried. I would later find out that he had blocked me on social media.  I feared my roommates at the university. The things they said horrified me. Their preposterous aversion towards gay people. How man go dey fuck man? If I catch any gay person, I go kill am! These were the people I was supposed to trust. I was the chef in the room. They praised my cooking. They appreciated my zeal to study and said that because they saw me study, they, too, wanted to study. But they did not know that I was gay. I wonder now, wistfully, what would have happened to me had they known.  On Valentines Day of this year, 2022, I received a book package at my room from a man who liked me. I did not like him. I lied to my roommates and told them that the gift was from a publishing company, a lie they believed given my interest in literature.  I would find out soon after almost that this man had married to please his family. I would tell him sorry again and again because I couldnt accept gifts from a married man. And I would return the books to the delivery man.  While I was home for a school break, my sister read through my diary. I kept it on my study desk, and she found it. She told me that she saw something about me, that she would tell me on a good day. I knew what she wanted to tell me. And she knew that I knew. That lucid yet silent comprehension hung over us.  We quarreled one day, and she said, I know you are gay!  Instead of anxiety, I felt relief.  We never talked about it again, but I feel that one day we will.  A few weeks ago, I stopped pressuring myself to succeed. Of course, I want to succeed but not in that overpowering way. Often, success is the only way to be respected as a queer person. That reality is sad and classist. And even that respect is stained with conditions. I come from a family where success is valued over most other things. There is a high probability that if I work hard and become successful, my parents will respect me after I tell them that Im gay. But why should I give in to societys expectations? Recently, after writing all night, I was reflecting on question and fell ill. I thought to myself, Why do I have to live at such a fast pace? After all, life is messy; you can work hard and still never achieve success. Im starting to take life slowly, letting life be, exploring faith from a newer prism, loving hard, learning and unlearning, and letting peace be.  Im focused on the present, writing, reading, putting the best I can offer in my academics, and spending quality time with my friends and family, educating them about gay rights from the straight ally point of view. When the time feels right, I will tell them who I am.  This body bears the proclamation of its lacerations. This body will live. This body will love.  I sit at my study desk, I open my diary, and I write boldly with my pen:  , an Igbo sentence that loosely translates to,  One day, the world will bend to the cadence of this body.  Chinonso Nzeh is Igbo, and his works have appeared in  ,  , and elsewhere. He thinks of storytelling as a way to comprehend the worlds wonder.

        "text": "Art by AmandaMacielAntunes Amanda Maciel Antunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread Ada snipped her hair with a pair of scissors, tufts of hair falling to and scattering across her dressing table. Photographs of Agbani Darego from various newspaper cutouts were tacked into the wall above her dressing table. In each, Agbani wore a velvety dress and a glittering silvery crown on her low-cut hair. Ada grinned. She would become a model. A popular model. Soon. She was preparing for the audition coming in a few weeks. It had taken three years for her to get the invite. For the first two years, she applied for the audition but received silence. Silence that stung her and wrung peace out of her mind. Shed sobbed and grumbled and refused food for some days until her husband, Ncheta, pacified her. And when, three months ago, she saw the invite in her mail, she screamed, ran to her husband, and hugged him tightly with tears in her eyes.  She rubbed her hair smooth with shea butter and admired her new look in the concave mirror pinned to the wall. Earlier that afternoon, shed washed her hair with conditioner and warm water. Now she swayed to an imaginary music, her steps measured, waving her hand at an imaginary audience. Then she saw Ncheta standing on the other side of the room near the doorway, his face lined with anger and his fists clenched. He started to approach her, but Ada hurried towards him and kissed his cheek, only for him to push her aside and into the wall. Ada stared at him with startled eyes.  Whats this? he shouted. Jesus! What the hell have you done? Held between the walls of her husbands sudden vexed actions and the pain of her bruised elbow, Ada winced. Ncheta grabbed her hand.  Why are you looking like this? He shook her.  Stop it, Ncheta. Stop it! Her words, mixed with spittle, settled on his face.  Ncheta didnt stop. He held her wrist tightly, the pain sinking deep into her bones.  Stop this. Youll wound me more. Ada flinched. Then she touched her wrist. Whats all this for?  You dont know what its for, huh? he yelled. When did I marry a woman looking like this, with this haircut? Answer me! Beads of sweat fell from his face and pelted Adas arm. She moved away from him. Barking, he tore down the photographs of Agbani on the wall, his voice thundering into the heart of the silent night. Its because of this nonsense, he said. No more. No more. He repeated it as he shredded everything.  Ada felt that the neighbors who lived in the next flat had heard Nchetas voice and would ask her in the morning if everything was alright. She didnt want that. She had been avoiding her neighbors snarky discussion about her. The shame of being asked about Nchetas bizarre rage struck her with silence and she went into the bathroom. Left: Amanda Maciel Antunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread   Right: Amanda Maciel Antunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread Two days later, Ada sat on the sofa, mindful of her bruised elbow that was gradually healing. She was flipping through channels on the TV when someone knocked on the door. The sound was heavy and unrelenting. Ncheta would never knock that way. Anxious, she started to the door, opened it, and found her mother-in-law, Nwanyi Mma, standing outside with another woman behind her dressed in a red dress and clutching a handbag. She was Auntie Ego, the wife of Nchetas uncle. Ada greeted them, but Nwanyi Mma only sized her up, sighed, then walked inside. Her curvy backside shook as her footsteps hit the tiled floor with agility. Nwanyi Mma had not changed, Ada thought. Her dark skin glowed with the elu-aki shed rubbed. Although gray hair peeked out of her gele, Nwanyi Mma remained Adas stout mother-in-law. On the other hand, Auntie Ego with her powdered face and neatly penciled eyebrows seemed younger. Ada whispered to her how beautiful she looked. Auntie Ego grinned and sat down. So, its true, Ada? Nwanyi Mma held her hands across her breasts. Ahn ahn. I cant believe it.  Ada stared at her, her face contorted in confusion. I don't understand, Mama.  You dont understand what? What is this? Nwanyi Mma yanked Adas stubby hair.  Ada winced in pain, moved away from her mother-in-law, and muttered curses upon her. Or do you want to kill my son? Tufiakwa. Nwanyi Mma spat and snapped her fingers. Over my dead body. She snapped her fingers again. Ada, Auntie Ego called her. The Umuada sent us here to confirm.  Confirm what? Ada widened her eyes.  That you cut your hair while your husband is still alive. Ada gawked at Auntie Ego, then at Nwanyi Mma, who blew hot with rage. She knew this wasnt some sort of joke. But it was still a joke to her, how these women had left the village miles away to tell her about what?  You must do something to this hair, Auntie Ego said. Before the news, I mean the truth, finds the women and the entire community. Youve to listen to her, Nwanyi Mma said. If it means using gum to put back the hair,  . A womans hair, Auntie Ego continued, I mean the decision to cut it, rests on her husband.  But I have a reason for cutting it. Ada snorted with displeasure. Are you not going to hear me out and know why I did it? Any married woman who cuts her hair when her husband is alive is inviting death upon her husband.  Ada stared at Auntie Ego, her mouth open.  Whatever reason it is, no married woman cuts her hair unless to honor her deceased husband. The Umuada do that. I mean the cutting of hair. But if for any reason youve to cut your hair while your husband is still alive, then your husband makes the decision. He cuts the hair himself. Auntie Ego saw how confused Ada was. Just do something about it. Anything. The three women fell silent, but filled the room with their stares: Nwanyi Mma and Auntie Ego watched Ada who watched the standing fan that stood close to the TV as it hummed. Ada felt as though her life was spinning and disappearing before her. Ada, Auntie Ego said. Did you hear what we said?  And one more thing, Nwanyi Mma said. Kill the idea of going out to show your body. She screwed up her face. I heard you want to join these people who . . . sometimes go naked in public. Go naked? Ada thought, her lip jutting out. Unbelievable! Like seriously? She couldnt imagine it now. Okay, Ill A smile flashed across Adas face. Mama, she looked at Nwanyi Mma, then at Auntie Ego. No problem. I have heard you. Ill do something. This, Ada knew, was a lie. She didnt know what she would do, but she needed the women to shut up and leave.   Amanda Maciel Antunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread That afternoon, Ada paced the room, mulling over the drama with the two women.   She ran to the bathroom to urinate, which shed done thrice in a few minutes. Once back in the room, she grabbed her phone and dialed Nchetas number. It rang but went unanswered. She dialed again and again until the metallic voice announced that the  . Ada fretted, her breathing fast. She picked up her phone once again, having decided that she would call her mother. But her mother did not answer. Ada dialed her mothers number again.  Hello, Mum. Good afternoon . . . Yes . . . I dont know. Didnt you go to work? . . . Alright. She breathed fast, listening to her mother talk about an incident that had happened at home. Ada became antsy at her mothers rambling. Mum, wait . . . oh yes, hes fine, she said after her mother asked about Ncheta. Ada couldnt wait. She cut in on her mother, told her mother about the stressful dilemma.  A married woman? her mother said.  Yes. Its forbidden. Highly forbidden unless upon the death of her husband, her mother said.  Ada didnt know what to say. She wanted to ask her mother if shed ever cut her hair. Perhaps before her father died. Itd been twenty-five years since her father died. Only a year old at the time, Ada remembered her father through his photographs.    She wanted to ask her mother, but all she heard was her own huff. Ada, is everything alright?  Yes. She exhaled. Or did you cut your hair?  Me? No, she said with a phony cadence. Okay, Mum. Bye.  Her mother called back again. Ada, why do I think youre hiding something from me?  Me? Nothing. Im hiding nothing.  If you say so. Her mother hung up. That night, Ncheta came home late and went right into the bathroom. Ada tried to remain calm as though she were still asleep. Just after hed dried himself and joined her in bed, Ada sneezed. Then she tossed so that her body touched his. Ncheta didnt speak or lift himself. Ada, a bit agitated, sat up and turned on the light. She stared at Ncheta whose eyes were shut. I cant imagine that you told your people about this. She nudged him. Ncheta said nothing. We need to talk. Ncheta turned to the edge of the bed. Don't worry me, he grunted.  What do you mean? This is my hair, my body for Christs sake. Goodness! I dont even understand all this!  Your body? He sat up, his back propped against the headboard. I dont have anything to say to you. He sighed and went back to sleep, leaving Ada to either empty or knot her rage. The next night, as they lay in bed, Ncheta grabbed Adas buttocks, slid his hand under her night dress, and moved up her thighs. Ada hit his hand. Don't touch me, she said. But Ncheta pulled her close to himself. She shrugged.  You want to deny me my right, abi? he said, gasping.  Ada stayed quiet. She tightened her lips, balled her fist. But she remembered the night when her mother had told her to be a good wife, to satisfy her husband so that he would not go after other women. This was after shed found condoms in his trousers. For days that grew into weeks, the thought of Ncheta in another womans bed troubled her. And when she informed her mother, her mother grew alarmed. Ada still couldnt believe what shed said. I understand. Maybe he wants it too much. Dont deny him your body. Ada wanted to scream no, that she had always obliged Ncheta herself.  She pursed her lips, then clasped the bedsheets. Her heart was racing, racing with fury. Ncheta was moaning. She shut her eyes, her mind filling with the image of unknown women hitting her. Terrified, she drew in air and tightened her fist on the mattress. Then she pushed Ncheta away, rolled out of the bed, covered her mouth, and ran to the bathroom, where she fell to the floor sobbing.   Almost immediately, Ncheta was at the door, turning the handle, trying to come in, banging on the door, ordering her to come out. But she would not. He growled, muttered something and smacked his head. Left: AmandaMacielAntunes,  , 2021, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread  Right: AmandaMacielAntunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread Three days later, Ncheta traveled to the village to see his mother. He navigated through the rocky, bumpy road flanked by huge guava and palm trees, inhaling the musty smell of harmattan wind. He knew he had missed this place and would like to spend some time herebut not now. Not today. Because he told his mother, as soon as he settled inside the parlor, how a mess his life was; how Ada would not talk to him; how his family was crumbling, and how he might go mad.  Shut up! Nwanyi Mma shouted. How can you say that because of a woman? Uh-huh?  Ncheta gawked at his mother, who was scolding him nonstop. He had thought of the best way to relay this to her, the best way to not light up her rage. Were talking about my wife, Mama. My family. He scratched his head.  And is your wife not a woman? She sneered. Listen, a woman must be submissive to her husband. Thats the way it should be. The way it has been.  Ncheta shrugged.   , that woman doesnt deserve to be your wife, Nwanyi Mma said, stone-faced. She should be running around, crying, pleading on how to be pardoned for what shes done. But no. Shes eaten a hard bone. Instead, you came here, running your mouth like anumanu, to plead on her behalf. She eyed Ncheta.  Its not what Im saying, Mama. Nwanyi Mma widened her eyes. Then whats it? She regarded him; her eyebrow furrowed. I wonder if you suckled these breasts. She shook her flaccid breasts. Youre a fool.  Mama, I want to settle this as a man, in my own way. Ncheta frowned at his mother, but she made a clicking sound behind her throat.  Nwanyi Mma grabbed her sons left arm and started shaking it. She looked into his eyes and said, You must be mad. Where have you learned this embarrassing disregard for our culture. Huh? Why does it demand too much from us? See, Mama, Im not interested in it anymore.  Shut up! That girl you call your wife cant . . .  Ncheta left her and walked to his car. Nwanyi Mma stood there, her hands fluttering in the air, yelling and cursing her son until he sped off, leaving her encased in a spiral of dust.  AmandaMacielAntunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread Ada returned to her mothers house. The three-bedroom apartment looked exactly the way it had the last time Ada came home: the peeling yellow paint, the flowers that gathered around the building and the small kitchen behind the house. Her mother emerged from the backyard, wiping her wet hands on her wrapper. Seeing Ada, her mother screamed and embraced her.  My goodness! Ada, what happened? her mother asked, staring at the bags beside Ada. Lets go inside.  I left Port Harcourt. I left his house, Ada said. Then she told her mother what had happened three days ago. She had been in UmuomaNchetas hometownhaving decided that she would prove before her mother-in-law and other women that she was innocent. That she had no intention of seeing Ncheta dead. Although Ncheta didnt want her to do it, he couldnt stop her. On the evening of the event, two women led Ada away only to bring her back with a white wrapper tied around her breasts. She stood barefoot with the other women around her. Ada swore that shed never thought of hurting Ncheta. Never thought him dead. Not for any reason. She repeated after the woman carrying the calabash filled with water from the shrine of the goddess. Should anything happen to Ncheta, let the goddess strike me dead.  Ada mumbled this at first, the words hanging behind her throat like a huge lump of eba. Ada didnt know what to do or say to the eyes around her, questioning or demeaning her. The woman held out the calabash to Ada, who stayed silent. Someone bellowed behind her: What is she waiting for!  She shook her head like a bird emerging out of water. As if her feet quickened under the burning earth, she took the calabash from the woman. It reeked of dead fish and rotten melon. Ada almost threw up. But she held her nose. She was conscious of the mocking voices of the other women, the bellow in Nwanyi Mmas voice, and the scorn in her eyes. She dropped the calabash and rushed out. The women, surprised and angered, screamed her name.  I couldn't do it, Mama. She made a clicking sound behind her throat. I'm tired of everything.  I knew it the moment you asked me about cutting of hair. Her mothers eyes were misty. She sniffled and said, I experienced a similar thing in the hands of your uncles when your father died. They accused me of killing him. They wanted me to swear. They wanted to silence me. She blinked her eyes. I didnt want to tell you this. I felt itd be different for you. I wanted it to be. Tears fell through her cheeks. Thats why I sent you away to Kaduna. I wanted to keep you away from here. I wish you married from another tribe. It would have been different. Maybe.  Ada stared at her mother, undone. She was sniffling, holding back her tears.  When your uncles wanted to rob me of your fathers property, nobody taught me to stand up for myself. You know what? She moved close to Ada and clasped her hands. Every woman deserves her dignity.  His family doesnt think I deserve that, Ada said. Especially his mother. Im just tired.  My daughter, to tell you the truth, you can survive the inadequacies of a partner, her mother said. But the taunts of in-laws can overwhelm you. When I noticed this, I was pregnant with you. Ada, I couldve miscarried you or something. Maybe disappear and marry again. No, I didnt. I chose to have you. I couldnt abandon an innocent child growing inside me. Mama, Ada said, her eyes widened, Are you saying I should go back to Ncheta? I cant stay in that house and carry all that burden. Ada shrugged. I want to be myself, Mama. After all, Im still twenty-six.  Are you pregnant for him?  Pregnant? No, Im not.  Good. The first thing men are taught to forget about us is that were humans. Her mother whispered to her. But you dont owe anybody your body or your life. Not even Ncheta. Youre going back to Port-Harcourt. Why? What for? Ada stood up. Or are you asking me to leave.  Far from it. Ada, you have a job, dont you? And you have a life. And your dream to be a model? You must never let marriage break or steal your dream. Go back to your life; a woman doesnt need a man or marriage to become whoever she wants to be.  Ada rested her head on her mothers shoulders. She felt the warmth of her mothers shoulder, the same warmth she felt when she was a baby. Her mother patted her back like she was crooning her to sleep. They stayed like that for a few seconds.  I still love him, Ada whispered.  Youll be fine. Trust me.    Amanda Maciel Antunes,  , 2022, 5 x 5 inches, photo-collage and thread Resplendent in a velvety dress that outlined her body, full and curvy, Ada was ready for the audition. For the last few days, she was unsure if today would come, couldnt believe that she would wear her dress and stiletto heels with poise before the tiny crowd gathered there. She rubbed her sweaty palms again and again. The DJ was blasting the room with 2Faces African Queen. Ada mumbled the lyrics and nodded to it. This was a song she admired, that redirected her to herself, and made her know her dream was valid. In the disco lighting, in every corner, at each table, people chatted and smiled and laughed, their faces streaked with neon red. Her mother couldnt come to Lagos. She had gone for a work seminar in Calabar. However, Ada brought her childhood friend, Ukamaka, to the event.  You can do this, Ukamaka said, holding Adas fidgety hands.   Thank you for being here. Always.  Of course, you know its nothing. Ukamaka whispered to Ada. Anything for you, babe.  Seriously? Ada picked up her phone, swiped it and messaged her mother. She told her mother that the event was about to begin. She hadnt thought that this event would be so glamorous.   Who are you texting? Ukamaka tapped Adas hand and tried to look at her screen.  What? Ada widened her eyes in surprise. My mother. Just her.  You dont want me to know the new man, abi? Ukamaka teased her. Its not good o. She puckered her lips.  I dont know what you are saying. Ada stretched her phone to Ukamaka. See? Its my mother. Are you fine now?  Dont mind me. Ukamaka grinned and touched Adas arm. Look behind. Ada did and there, a few tables behind theirs, Ncheta was seated. He smiled at Ada. She could feel her eyes grow larger, bulge, as though she was embarrassed.  I cant wait to see both of you back together. Ukamaka looked at Ncheta, who was still looking their way. It wont happen, Ada said. I know my limits now.  What do you mean?  She smiled. Im a woman who is aware of her limitless force.  I think he still loves you. Ukamaka looked at Ncheta. Hes here. For you.  I love him too, Uka.  Then go back to him.  Ada shook her head. I wont.  But why?  See, Uka, you can love someone and still want to stay away from them. Sometimes its better for everyone.  Someone spoke into the microphone. The hall fell quiet. After a few introductions and announcements, the contestants started strutting to the stage. Ada stood up, drew in a deep breath.  Ukamaka took her hands. Good luck, Ada, she said.  Ada smiled, her face lit up with excitement. Before she swaggered to the stage, she turned around towards Ncheta and saw him clapping. Then he waved at her.

        "title": "The Puerto Rican  Evergreen Review",
        "author": "Bruce Benderson",
        "text": "Art by Kevin Tobin Kevin Tobin,  , 2022. Oil on panel, 24 x 24 inches The Puerto Rican boy wearing a tank top was tall and muscled, but his face with its prominent cheekbones had something vulnerable about it. It was one of those faces that you dont miss in a dark hole of a bar like this, because the color of the skin and the fixity of his large eyes seemed to detach from the crowd of people like something phosphorescent. Yes, it was a face surging from another dimension, slightly incandescent with suffering. It was, to tell the truth, a brutal face, and at the same time, it was a masochistic-looking face, like that of a saint. For more than an hour Id been studying him in his red tank top, his enormous shoulders expanding each time that he bent over the pool table. It was obvious that he was aware of my gaze, but he did not look back a single time. Instead, he performed a ballet intended specifically for me, which consisted of steps and turns that were perfectly executed, between the bar and the pool table, as well as different methods of bending over the table, accompanied by extensions of his long and muscled arms each struck he struck a ball with the cue stick. After a while, I went to the mens room and was startled to see a couple who were doing cocaine. One was a man of around forty, and the other was a hustler of about twenty. In front of the urinal, the hustler had taken out his prick, which was hard, and the man was bending over it. With great speed and precision, the man tipped out a line of cocaine along the length of the hard dick, and then consumed it with a single snort. Only seconds later, the Puerto Rican came in. He gave sign of wanting to talk with me, although I would have spoken to him regardless, but I was somewhat discombobulated by the scene Id just witnessed, and before I could find my voice, the Puerto Rican had already pissed and left. Kevin Tobin,  , 2021  Oil on canvas stretched over hollow core door, 80 x 36 inches I followed him to the bar where the two of us took our respective places. He started another game of pool, and I began to watch him exactly as I had before. Soon I became convinced that he wanted to speak to me as much as I to him but that there was some barrier preventing it. Like the bodies of two lovers who have been separated, our bodies took on a look of deprivation. He was still avoiding my gaze, but it was becoming obvious that he was becoming more and more irritated by the fact that I wasnt coming up to him. His body betrayed tiny spasms of nervousness that seemed to stem from his impatience about our drama. As for me, I was just as frustrated by the situation, but something was holding me back and I remained incapable of coming over to him. Slowly, several others were beginning to notice our game, and they began to study us. The fact that they were intensified our excitement, and the Puerto Rican, who was wearing rather tight trousers, began to get an erection; but aside from that, there was no change in his behavior. He kept playing pool without looking at me. When the situation was nearly unbearable, I decided to order him a drink. I gave the waiter specific orders. The Puerto Rican could have whatever he wanted to drink. The price wasnt important, and as the waiter served it, he was to indicate discreetly that it was from me. The waiter did exactly as I asked. I watched as he handed a very expensive drink to the Puerto Rican. I think it was an Ice Tea, the kind composed of several different liquors. The Puerto Rican took hold of the glass and raised it in the air. For the first time, he looked at me with a somewhat flirtatious smile. At that moment, all the lights went on. Two cops came rushing into the bar. At first I thought it had something to do with the couple Id seen in the mens room taking cocaine, but the cops had stopped on either side of the Puerto Rican. Rapidly, they slipped a pair of handcuffs on him. Then they led him roughly from the bar while everyone watched. The bar fell completely silent, as the luminous, paling, and impassive face of the Puerto Rican, looking more and more handsome, framed by the two cops and their smug expressions, moved farther and farther away from his expensive drink.

        "text": "Art by Kevin Tobin An excerpt from   by Christopher Stoddard The Uber ride back to the hotel in Santa Monica after picking up drugs in downtown L.A. will take Brandon an estimated twenty minutes, but it already feels much longer. Darkness surrounds the car, save for intermittent streetlights along the highway and scattered lights in the windows of low-rise buildings that make up this sprawling, suburban metropolis. To stave off his impatient need to snort away the two hundred bucks in powdered form thats burning a hole in his shorts, he logs on to Grindr, switching the zip code to the hotels, in search of men who are online and in the area.  A drunken group of happy hour victims are outside the main entrance to the hotel when he arrives. Theyre smoking   cigarettes ingaspL.A. Their heads rubberneck in his direction as he exits the car. The two girls are gaping shamelessly at him. Before he can escape inside, the shorter of the blond pair grabs him by the arm. Um, hi, so my girl over there thinks youre super hot. Want to say hi? The other one lowers her head, her hand acting as a visor to hide her flushed cheeks. Oh my god, Christine, stop! Whats up bro, one of the cookie cutter hot dudes interjects. Want to have a cig with us? Hes wearing a fitted black suit, sans tie or loosened collar.  If he were offering on his own behalf, the answer would be hell yes, but alas Im good, thanks. Your friend is cute, but Im not into girls, Brandon discloses.  The failed, messy matchmaker drops back her bleached head, roaring at the clear night sky. Fuck, of course! Brandon shrugs, a superficial apology for preferring dick. He rushes inside before having to suffer through more. Perhaps hell find the hot dude on Grindr later. Straight, discreet, looking for now. Like The Flash, Brandon whizzes through the lobby into the first elevator car. He swipes his keycard and hits the button for the second floor. He taps the close button repeatedly as if he were sending an urgent telegram, praying to no one that the doors slide shut before someone else arrives. Shared elevators exacerbate his claustrophobia, especially when hes in a rush to do drugs and find a dude to do him.  Kevin Tobin,  , 2021-2022.  Oil, flashe, spray paint and wax on hollow core doors, 80 x 72 inches This being his third visit to Santa Monica Proper Hotel, hes familiar with the zigs and zags of the hallways and interconnected buildings, barely having to look up at the arrows and range of room numbers at every corner to find his room. The peepholes on the doors are just peepholes, but he knows after a few lines theyll become evil eyes copping his every move, even when hes on the other side of the one living in the door to his room. The eye will just do a one-eighty. The first hour or so is a pleasure. The beginning of the high motivates Brandon to shower, moisturize, coif and conceal, and dress in his hookup uniform, a plain black T-shirt and gym shorts. Before opening the Grindr app on his iPhone, he answers a few demanding work emails that wouldve raised his anxiety if he was sober. He responds to the urgent requests from clients and co-workers in an obliging tone that borders on peppy, quite the antithesis to his trademark sass. They reply with emojis of praying hands and bright yellow hearts, pleasantly surprised by his sudden flexibility. Phase two of his evening begins with two more lines, beer and vodka from the mini fridge, the initial signs of anxiety and paranoia seeping from his brain into his chest, and a tingling in his crotch. He quits all work applications on his laptop, opens Apple Music to play chill but upbeat tunes, specifically the album   by Robyn. He sets aside the laptop on the other side of the king-sized bed and commences the search on his phone for more strangers. Just as he opens Grindr, a banner notification appears. His boyfriend is texting, likely to say that hes having trouble sleeping without him in bed. Brandon will struggle to sleep tonight, too, but for very different reasons. He thumbs his boyfriend away, mildly annoyed at the inadvertent cock-block, making a mental note to tell him tomorrow that he was already sleeping when he messaged him. Long day. Brandons profile pic on Grindr is from his shirtless torso collection of a couple years ago, when he was single and a few pounds lighter. The tattoos on his arms are visible, which would be a no-no if he were in New York, but hes not. Hes thousands of miles away, where he isnt at risk of being recognized by anyone who may know his boyfriend. Hes   they agreed to a dont-ask-dont-tell open relationship when they were drunk and high one night last year. He boldly advertises hes looking to suck straight or masculine bi cock. He selects discreet as his tribe and filters his search to white tops only.  He isnt racist or anything like that; he just isnt attracted to men of color. His preferences may stem from the subconscious racism that comes with being white in America, he realizes, but he doesnt believe its his fault. He doesnt understand why he should force himself to fuck people he doesnt want just to be politically correct. No one needs to know about the various white boys he enlists to dick him down on whatever night. Kevin Tobin,  , 2022. Oil on panel, 16 x 16 inches The clock on the nightstand reads after midnight. Brandon rinses his hands, sops up the blood on the back of his head with two white hand towels, staining them crimson. He tosses them in the trash, covering them with a ball of toilet paper. With a desperate urge to get out of the room, he exits without looking in the mirror to see the bloody, torn black T-shirt, the semen stains on his shorts hardening and turning white.  Hes just walking. Hes walking and humming Nights by Frank Ocean and just strolling down the hall without a care in the world. Adrenaline has replaced his craving for more coke. Hes higher than ever.  In the elevator, a lesbian couple holding hands, both with long braids and matching white and camel-colored linen outfits, stand aghast at his appearance, but he doesnt notice. Hes just riding the elevator, minding his own business. They ask him if hes okay, but their concerned voices fall on deaf ears. Nights is blaring from the speakers in his brain.  The doors open and he walks out slowly. The couple rushes past him to get help from the front desk. He exits enveloped in Franks singing voice, consumed by the intensifying natural high. But then he collapses, and as his face meets the hard lobby floor, he feels absolutely nothing.  He wipes the coke crumbs off the bathroom sink with the palm of his hand and licks them clean. He collects the empty beer cans and tiny vodka bottles, placing them neatly on top of the mini fridge. In front of the wardrobe, he piles high the clothes that were strewn about the room. He dims the lights and flips Robyn over to Frank Ocean, lowering the volume so its less of a soundtrack for the forthcoming sex and more just background noise to fill the uncomfortable silence of strangers meeting and fucking. One of his pet peeves is when his bobbing head syncs with the bass of the music.  Cocaine comes back to mind. He can use one more line before sex. Dropping to his knees at the bathroom entrance, he sticks his finger in the space between the corner of the doorframe and the marble threshold where he dropped the coke. Digging around inside, he realizes the hole is much deeper than he thought. His finger barely grazes the tip of the plastic baggie of powdered salvation. Hes pushed it deeper into the hole, so its now well under the threshold and out of reach. His heart is speeding to the point of reckless endangerment.  Fuck fuck fuck! He must hurry. The guy will be here soon.  Rummaging through a toiletry bag, he finds his tweezers and shoves them in the hole in the hopes of getting a grip on the baggie, but to no avail. When he pulls out his finger, its bloody from scraping it against a nail in the floor. The tweezers are bent out of shape and permanently unusable. He chucks them across the room and resorts to pulling up the carpet that borders the marble threshold, revealing an unfinished wood platform. From there hes able to grip the threshold with his clammy hands and pull with all his might. The Equinox classes that his bestie is always dragging him to have paid off. The marble breaks into two pieces, one of them cutting his palm. The force of the release propels him backward, causing him to hit his head on the edge of the bed frame. Dazed and determined, he thrusts himself back up to his knees. He scans the wreckage for his Precious, and there it is, covered in blood. Luckily, the baggie was shut tightly, so the blow hasnt been contaminated. After rinsing his hands, which refuse to stop bleeding, he uses a hand towel to block the blood flow and awards himself with a fat rail of coke. He gets back on his knees to piece the bloody marble threshold back together like a gruesome puzzle. He wipes it down and smooths the carpet back in place as best he can. At first glance, the destruction isnt noticeable, so he should be able to get away with it. By the time the hotel staff, or perhaps the next guest, discovers it, itll be impossible to determine who did it. It couldve been anyone who used this room previously or will in the future. By the time the front desk calls, informing him of his guests arrival, hes a sweaty mess again. The last soaked T-shirt, chilled by the air conditioning on full blast, is a lovely cooling agent for his overheated brow. He darts into the bathroom for one last beauty check in the mirror, and notices he needs a little more concealer to hide his puffy eyes and darkening circles. The guy knocks on the door as hes blending in the makeup with the tip of a shaky digit. Deep breath, he tells his reflection. The well-practiced smile that lifts his features and a few years of age comes into view. The Botox he had injected about a week and a half ago is in full effect, so his crows feet are nowhere to be found. Hes ready for whats behind door number-one.  Okay, Brandon. Lets do this.  Kevin Tobin,  , 2022.  Oil, flashe, spray paint and wax on hollow core door, 80 x 36 inches The sweet sound of Frank Ocean singing Chanel wakes Brandon from his violently induced slumber. His hand and the back of his head are throbbing. The delayed pain has arrived, causing him to wince audibly. The water is running in the bathroom sink, the air in the room cold against his freezing, vibrating skin. His heart is pounding, and hes wet with sweat and blood. The night comes back to him like the scent of a memory. Pulling himself up by the end of the mattress, he struggles to stand fully because his shorts and boxer briefs are constricting his ankles. He remembers what happened and starts to cry.  The track flips to Nights, the lyrics apropos of his cruel, secretive encounter with the stranger. The difference between the story in the song and whats happened in real life is that Franks reluctant tryst was ultimately consensual. With the stranger, it turned into anything but; after Brandon tried rejecting him at the door because the guy looked nothing like his picture, he forced himself inside. Brandon rolls over in tears, the condom protruding from his anus lightly slapping his inner thigh. He flinches at the stinging sensation as he pulls it out, noticing its ripped.   He casts back to the time he blew the quarterback in high school in someones basement during a house party. The next day Brandon told everybody, so he wasnt shocked when the football player and his teammates jumped him in retaliation for spreading the lie. Brandon took the beating in silence. Having hid his effeminacy as best he could when he was a kid, he rarely received a sideways look, let alone a classmate calling him a fag. Hed always wondered what it was like being gay-bashed, but he never thought itd be instigated by his own actions. Its no wonder hes lying on the floor, soaking up the carpet with his blood and tears, blaming himself for the attack. He shouldve known better.  He considers calling 911 but decides against it. There are drugs somewhere in the room, unless the stranger took the baggie. Bottles are everywhere. The floor near the bathroom is in shreds. Whats more, this is a business trip, and his employer would surely fire him for this. Hes not positive the stranger raped him, anyway. He couldve been obliging after the guy chucked him onto the bed. But then a flashback of the sock in his mouth, his wrists cuffed with the strangers large hand. Faggot this and faggot that. If you say something to anyone, I will fucking kill you. The common line in movies and TV shows that depict rape and sexual assault proved to be accurate.  The clock on the nightstand reads after midnight. Brandon rinses his hands, sops up the blood on the back of his head with two white hand towels, staining them crimson. He tosses them in the trash, covering them with a ball of toilet paper.

He often utilizes medical photography and painterly abstraction to collapse interior and exterior anatomies, and circumvent the didactic politics of identity in the service of making figurative painting mysterious again.

        "title": "On Yazd, Yogurt, and Zoroastrian Identity  Evergreen Review",
        "author": "Homa Dashtaki",
        "text": "Images courtesy of the author My forty-three-year-old female body has moved through the world with the broken heart of an eight-year-old Zoroastrian girl ripped away from her ancestral lands and brought to America to inhabit the wide-eyed optimism of an American dreamer.    I was born in Tehran, Iran, at the eve of the Revolution. My dad is from Mobarakeh province in Yazd, my mom was born in Kharaget colony in Bombay and her parents are from Aliabad, also in Yazd. They got married in Tehran, and the common language in their marriage was Dari. It was the common language in our household. We lived in Iran for eight years of my life. The seasons dictated so much of the beauty there. In winters when it was cold enough, the snow was cartoonishly fluffy, landing on branches and cars with rounded edges. We had a pear tree that would blossom in an exuberant burst of springtime blossoms, leading to the most fragrant pears in late summer. I remember our school bus driver giving us girls on the bus a piece of warm   bread as we boarded; I would gut the bread of its soft innards and roll them into a ball before popping them in my mouth.  In the midst of the Iran-Iraq War, at the age of eight, I emigrated with my family, my mom, my dad, my younger sister Nahid, to Southern California. There was a large group of Iranian Zoroastrians there, and we found a home there. Or, we carved out some spaces where we felt safe inside before having to put on our costumes to navigate the outside spaces.   In my years in the United States, I did everything to fit in, which means not only surviving, but also thriving. I learned the language and got rid of my accent, I learned to dress the part. I learned to excel in academics. And there is an inherent sense of betraying your own heritage as you adopt a new one. And I struggled with that a lot. There was a very heavy and acute sense of mourning for me as well, to be away from the motherland that I knew that for the rituals, that became my religion, that became a lot of my comforts.  The one place where I was always comfortable was at the Zoroastrian center in Westminster that Morvarid and Rustam Guiv built. I saw that place first exist as a house in the suburbs and evolve to a proper center built with a parking lot. It was a place you went to and didnt have to explain yourself. It was a place you went to and the language was all the same. The food was all the same. The holidays were all the same. Nobody questioned anything. There was communal cooking, there was communal eating. And there was a very big comfort in that for me because that foundation was very safe: to be an individual, to be different, to be unique, to not fit the mold. I joined the   (Events Group) and remember planning things we had never ever celebrated before. Valentines Day; New Years Eve on December 31, in addition to our own Nowruz in March. The Super Bowl was surprisingly a big deal. We would put together all the proper snacks: pizza, wings, soda, chips and moosir. We would get a big screen and projector and watch the big game. To this day, I question whether anyone ever really understood a damn thing about football or if this was a safe space to practice being American. From my twenties to early thirties, I stepped away from the community to spread my wings, taking all my practice with me. I studied literature and ended up becoming a finance lawyer based in New York City. I loved playacting the role of a female lawyer in Manhattan. I loved the big office buildings, I loved the suits, the shoes, the big important things I got to sayall costumes and sets and scripts to my heart. As much as I liked to play an American lawyer lady, at home I was also playing the role of holding on to so much of our culture and foods and language. I would go out of my way to celebrate Yalda and Sadeh and the Ghahambars. I would wear   all over the place. I always kept in mind not just what my grandparents and my ancestors went through to hold on to the religion and our culture back in Iran, but also what my parents and my community in California were doing here.  I have felt the tight grip of holding on to two disparate identities; I have felt the ache of letting them rip me apart.  And this is where the yogurt becomes very, very relevant. When I was eventually laid off from the lawyer gig during the 2009 financial crash, I quite naturally, decided to make yogurt, and I make yogurt in a very traditional Yazdi style. I make it extremely inefficiently mimicking the process in ceramic bowls, and we wrap it up in blankets. I know that other Iranians have family members who do it just this way. But I was determined to make a business of this. This is an insane business endeavor to undertake when every other yogurt in the market is made within a matter of six hours and mine was made in a matter of three days. We named the business White Moustache after my dads white handlebar moustache. I worked with him, my mom, and my sister, side by side at the beginning. And this became a therapeutic process for me. It connected me to my ancestors, it connected me to my own history, but also to my own future. It connected me to my immediate family in a way that was very relevant and light. It didnt have the gravity of survival or prestige or anything. It was just to make something with our hands, and to spend time together. I made flavors that were familiar to me, not altered for a Western audience. I made   (sour cherry),   (quince),   (date),  .  It was a calling. And it really has saved my life. And it gave me a sense of validity and a sense of identity that I otherwise didnt have here in America. I finally made sense as an individualall the complicated different parts of me made sense.  I finally felt very strong in my identity as Iranian Zoroastrian living in America, which was extremely difficult. It was a combination of a lot of prayers, a lot of yogurt, and a lot of therapy. And it was so liberating at that moment, that I realized my future was perhaps in better hands than I knew to imagine. With the freedom of knowing my identity as a Zoroastrian was secure and I was calm within myself, I felt free that my personal life could take any course laid before it. I could marry a non-Zoroastrian; I could marry Zoroastrian. I could marry a man; I could marry a woman, I could decide to be a single mother. At thirty-five years old, I could admit to myself the loneliness that felt too consequential to admit earlier in my life and I got very serious about finding a life partner. I approached Parsi matchmakers, I approached Iranian matchmakers. I assumed this would somehow be easy, that this was where I would find someone with the most in common with me. The hot Parsi baker from Bombay was confused by my genuine esteem for a good fart jokes! The brilliant Iranian man whose old soul I instantly connected with, who I knew would always keep one foot in the past for me! It turned out that religion, while the cornerstone of my identity, was not the communion I needed in a relationship. To my own pleasant dismay, I ended up falling deeply in love with a white dude I met on OkCupid.com. In Michaels heart, for the first time since I was that eight-year-old girl, I found a home. And here, I am free to be silly. I am free to be sexual. I am free to be fun. Im free to be complicated. Im free to have the beautiful children that I never thought I would get to have. Im free to exist in a very authentic way to myself. But for so much of my life, I felt I had no one to talk to about that heaviness of being born into the Zoroastrian faith. There were no role models for my generation and I was too scared to forge a path I had not seen. I didnt want to take a wrong step and be the last generation of Zoroastrian who just got it wrong, or desecrated our ancestors, or worse, ruined it for future generations. So for a majority of my youth, I felt that it was easier to be alone or noncommittal or casual. How could I take a wrong step, if I didnt take any steps at all in my personal life?  Sharing my personal story has been really, really hard for me. One reason is that I feel alone as I tell my story. And thats a remnant of how I grew up, and how I thought of carrying that burdenour identityand how I felt like a lot of times we dont talk about the pain and the suffering that we feel. Instead, we put a gloss on how lovely and fine everything is. And I dont feel seen sometimes when I talk about my personal story; I feel like I am making a fool of myself talking about my feelings and no one gets it.  And the hardest part of all is I think that heaviness that is felt by the indigenous Iranian Zoroastrians who are born into this religion is often dismissed. And sometimes we do it to ourselves. We dont talk about the difficult stuff. And it makes it very taxing to explore themes of identity and belonging that are personal to every individualand to do that in an authentic way. In America, it feels like I had to either erase myself or exaggerate myself to survive, so as not to offend the host country. I would soften the harsh smells of my food and use chives instead of  ; tone down my fashion choices to blend in; speak in a soft measured voice to my mother so I wouldnt sound screaming mad. Or, alternatively, I could play up the kohl of my eyes, the exoticness of my name, adorn everything with paisley and pomegranates and become the token Persian friend. And in the meantime, the real pieces of me would have disappeared. The real pieces of me, that I needed so desperately to rise up with and feel so alive in, they had no fertile future for flourishing within this system.   And while my journey may have been more unique than most, being a minority within a minority, it may provide a magnifying glass for many whove found their individual spirits also shoved and buried by systems that they can never quite touch but are nonetheless indispensable parts of.

        "text": "Art by Tom Jarmusch Lunch is tuna fish and milk. Not for my brothers and me. For Precious. Nana is folding money tightly, pressing it into my big brother Pokes hand. She gives an order shes given a thousand times before. Poke, go on down to the store and get Preciouss lunch, she says.   This morning, breakfast was a slice of bread and water at dawn. Thats not enough for me. I know its not enough for Poke, him being bigger and all, but he never says a word about it. Now we will have to wait for supper leftovers for sure; greasy string beans from last Saturday with pork fat jiggling on top or salty six-month-old beans pulled from the freezer. Nothing as fresh and eat-it-now as tuna fish and milk. I am dying to go to the store with Poke. Maybe along the way well find some money, coins accidentally dropped or a dollar bill stuck in the sewage drain. Maybe even enough to get a couple of Mary Jane candies or a bag of lemon drops. I can taste the peanut butter and feel the sugar rush as I follow Poke out the door.   Where you think you going? Nana barks.  To the store with Poke, I say.  No you aint. Pokes the oldest. Pokell go. You dont need to go nowhere. She points to the white gardenias painted on the sofa. Sit, she says. The flavors of delight sour in my mouth and give way to cardboard-flavored spit. I sit down on the hot, plastic-covered sofa and it sears the back of my thighs like a griddle. The room is stifling. I cant breathe any more than the gardenias beneath me, the white petals stretching wide into exhausted yawns, hollow as my stomach. A layer of sweat coats my skin as the cracks in the hard plastic slice into my thigh.  Nana wont open any windows. She says shell be damned if she lets her good air out. That raggedy machine, shoved into the weary window of her bedroom in the back, pushes out nothing but hot breath. Nana swears the air from that thing is as cool and crisp as the morning breeze. So did the junkyard man who sold it to her with a sly smile. But you cant tell Nana anything. I look at the plants in the corner next to the sofa that climb halfway up the wall and spread over the glass end table. The thick philodendron leaves bury the heads of the little white ceramic angels sitting on the tabletop. Nanas stories are on the television, and she sits in the easy chair without looking away from the screen. My little brother haunts the other end of the sofa sucking his thumb, now a permanent part of his mouth, his face, his soul. Together we float on the barge in silence.   When I shift to give my slashed flesh relief, I accidentally knock the lace coverlet to the floor. Nana hears the swish and jerks her head to look at me. Her big bumper curls, freshly done by Ms. Jackson down the street, bob back and forth in the thick air like buoys on water. Just a minute ago, her eyes were light and bubbly from the latest twist in who is having an affair. Now they are glowing charcoals at the bottom of a grill. Damn it, boy, she snarls.  Sorry, Nana, I say.  Nana sucks her teeth. She loves to suck her teeth. Yeah, you always sorry, she says.  You aint got nothing else in your cup but that. Your mother didnt leave me nothing but you kids and a sorry.  And then I feel it again. I cant even hear Nanas words anymore or feel the heat burning at me from her eyes because there it is again. Suddenly, there is coolness on the back of my neck. It vanishes and the chill turns again into hot sweat.  Nana gets up from her blue easy chair, huffing and puffing. She bends down, struggling, and picks up the lace I knocked to the floor and fans it into the air and carefully places it back on the sofa. The leaves of all the plants quiver. My little brother sucks his thumb harder. I take the chance to escape. I have to go to the bathroom, I announce, and move away quickly. Normally, Nana makes me hold it. My brothers too. She says she doesnt know one man who can control himself. You damn well better hold it, she likes to say. And we hold it until our bladders churn bile to butter. We clutch our privates until our stomachs do somersaults and sirens in our heads bang and clang us deaf. When our eyes bulge out like a full moon and we walk like old men, she is satisfied.   Precious is let outside anytime she paws the front door.  But my timing is good and I know it. Between messing up the sofa lace and interrupting her stories, I know she cant focus much on how much urine Im holding. She rolls her eyes and sits back down. The pleading man on the TV has already told his wife that he is sleeping with her sister. Nana throws her head back. Lord, you made me miss it, boy! she says. But by then, I am already halfway down the hallway to the bathroom. My brothers and I share a room. First door on the left. There is nothing much in there: one bed for the three of us, a closet, and a seven-drawer chest with a green desk lamp on it. The lamp is just for show. Nana never puts a bulb in it. She says that whatever we need to do, we can do before dark. Our shoes line a bed that takes a day to dry out from us sweating through it all night. The windows are nailed shut. Nana says a fan would run up her light bill. Some nights I lie on the floor along the wall. The rats living behind the crumbling plaster crawl in and out of the tunnels they make, and I can feel the air moving through their tiny halls. Nanas room is the second door on the left. She always leaves the door open halfway; half-open to remind us that it is her house and half-closed to remind us that we are forbidden to enter. There is a yellow cotton quilt spread over her bed, a matching runner on the floor. All day long the preacher shouts from the clock radio sitting on the crowded nightstand, the air conditioner gasping and heaving in the background.  And there in the middle of the bed, turned toward the muggy breeze, is Precious. Nana says that Precious is a special-bred cat but I know shes a mongrel. For one, the thing is cockeyed and her one good eye has a river of muck running from it all of the time. Second, she looks Siamese from the back and calico from the front and it all crashes in an explosion of fur and patterns. Always, she is looking over her empire, perched on the bed like a queen on a throne.   God, how I hate that cat.  I reach the bathroom at the very end of the hallway. At the toilet, I decide this time Ill hold it. Not because I have to but because I can. In the hidden spaces of my body, I have the kind of dick control Nana never thought possible. Now I prepare for a delicious thing. I turn the cold water on full blast and dunk my head in the sink. And I let the cold hold me, caress my brow.   She just has a lot of things to take care of first. Business to tend. Thats why she kissed each of us on the forehead at three oclock in the morning in Nanas living room the day she left. We dont want to wake Nana, Mama had whispered. You know Nana works hard, and it wouldnt be right to wake her up in the middle of the night. Aint that right, my little men? We little men nodded. Mama held up a bright, shiny gold key. See babies? Mamas got a key to the front door, so I can come right on in any old time. Dont you worry. Mamas got some things to take care of. Got some business now. But Ill be back before you know it. At the sink the cold nestles me and I think. Shell be back before I know it. Soon. After while. One day. I blow air bubbles from my nose and they tickle my cheeks on the way to the surface. I listen to the silence underwater. I wonder about the place that cold comes from. Must be a fantastic place.  There were a few times before when I felt the frost from that special land outside of the sink. Like when Nana slapped my cheek for eating her apple. It fell out of the sack she keeps in the locked cabinet and rolled under the kitchen table. I watched it sit there for three days, red and turning brown. On the fourth day I picked it up and I ate it, and she slapped me. She belts me plenty so the slap wasnt really nothing to care about. My face always flames when her fat paw hits it. But that time my cheek went icy. Chilled like a body on a slab. Nana went to hit me again, but when her hand touched my face, she drew back. Thats when I knew that the other world, the cold one, was real. I raise my head from the water. Cant take too long in the bathroom or Nana will be at the door, checking if Im running up her water bill or using her good towels. The ones with the three red tulips emblazoned on the front. I take one out and dab it on my face, then brush and rub the cotton this way and that. I fold it exactly the way it was and put it on top of the linen stack. Nana never checks for wetness, only for the neatness of the tulips. She doesnt use the towels but likes to open the closet and look at the order of the pile. I flush the toilet (for show) and click out the light.  My brother Poke is back. He is standing at the kitchen table clutching a brown paper bag and thrusting his fingers into the bottom of his pant pocket to get Nanas change. You get the chunk tuna in vegetable oil? Nana yells from the easy chair. Yes, Nana, Poke says.  You get the pint of whole milk? Not that two percent mess, right? No, Maam. I got the regular kind.  Nana comes in the kitchen humming. She reaches up to the top cabinet above the refrigerator and pulls out two delicate glass bowls. She takes the bag from Pokes hand and opens the can of tuna fish. After carefully forking out the flakes of tuna into the bowl, she grabs the pint of milk and shakes it vigorously. The foam fans out in fluffy splendor when she pours it into the crystal. Perfection. Lunch is a wonderful thing. The whole world stops whatever it is doing at some point in the day for it. People wait on it all morning and feel funny when they havent had it. Thats just how special it is. Bet the President stops for lunch too. You can tell how certified a guy is by his lunch. A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is okay but shows haste and a lack of style. Baloney or ham is something to respect. But the kind of lunch that requires a napkin, the kind that is better hot but still tastes dynamite when its cold, well, that is something out of this world.  Nana sits the dishes on the floor. Precious! she chimes at the top of her lungs. She never has to call Precious twice. The cat arrives in the kitchen on cue for a two-course meal, moving from one bowl to the other. Nana stands over the thing smiling and cooing, Thats it, baby. Enjoy your lunch. You know Mama wouldnt forget about her Precious.  We watch Precious eat.   A violent cough breaks Pokes stare. Bet he has asthma. Probably from the fur floating through all this good air. The cough takes Nanas attention away from the feast, and her eyes go from Saturday-night-bliss to Monday-morning-piss. You little bastards always sick, she says. Poke, go in there and get the cough syrup. Take a little and give some to your brothers. Cant have all of you sick in here. Theres soda crackers on the table to settle your stomach. Nana pets Precious on the head and goes back into the living room to her stories to see if someone else is confessing a sin.  So thats lunch. Soda crackers and a swallow of cough syrup. Precious turns her tail up in the air. Her purring rings loud in my head. Milk dangles on the ends of her whiskers and hits the floor in little raindrops.   And then the coldness from that place rushes all over me. I dont know how it found me through all that time and space it must have taken to get to me but it did. The chill stays with me all day and into the night. I even stop sweating. In the late evening darkness, everything feels cool to the touch, and the spot in the bed where I lie stays cold long after I sink into the dents.  Maybe its the cold that makes me think about it.   I walk down the hallway and into the living room after everyone is asleep. Oh, how fresh the air all around me feels. The floor is a frozen lake. The streetlight pouring in from the window is an October moon.   I see the fiend on the sofa. She is luxuriating in the silver beam. The thing purrs briefly, a careless, thoughtless greeting to me. Me, who was left in favor of tending business. Me, whose cup is full of sorry. I snatch the lace sofa coverlet and wrap the little beast in it tight. She struggles but her clawless paws are no help and her hiss cannot be heard. And I am not surprised when I feel my hands strangling the flesh, squeezing the fur, my nails digging, because I have felt this feeling in the cold before, long before I got to the end of the hallway.  The headless angels on the end table wait for me. I pick one up and smash it into the creatures skull. I remember reading in Websters Dictionary that the word precious means something held dear. Am I held dear? Am I precious? I look down at the purple dripping from my hands in the moonlight. And right then I know I am more precious than business tending. More precious than soda crackers and rat tunnels. More precious than confessing husbands and choking gardenias. More precious than this damned cat. Yes. I know because the cold told me so.

        "text": "Art by Parastou Forouhar Parastou Forouhar   from the series \"Papillon Collection II,\" 2021. Digital drawing When I was seven years old, my parents forced me to accompany them on a road to the holy city of Qom to visit some of my moms relatives at a mosque. At that time, Qom was just about the last place on earth that a kid like me would want to visit, because there was nothing there except for prayer and mourning and general ruefulness. It was July 1995, the hottest time of the year, and the drive from our apartment in Tehran to Qom was around two hours. The air-conditioner in the car was broken, and my parents didnt want me to complain, so theyd packed a lunchbox full of cold sodas and snacks to keep me quiet in the backseat. I was eating fruit rollups and sipping my third Coca-Cola bottle, when all of a sudden, after about an hour or so, I had to pee.  Theres no place to stop, my father said. Youre gonna have to wait til we get to the mosque. But I cant hold it for that long. Well, you better make it go away somehow. Squeeze the tip of your tube with your thighs until the pee goes back up to your stomach.  My father was a military man whod barely finished high school and his low-brow visceral humor always irritated my mother. She was a middle school algebra teacher who valued education and propriety, and she told him how idiotic he sounded (Do you really think thats how human bodies work?) Their conversation turned into an argument about how parents ought to speak to their children, and eventually things got so heated that my father started howling obscenities at the top of his lungs. I was too scared to say anything, so I had no choice but to plug up my tube for the rest of the way.  Parastou Forouhar  , 2021. Digital drawing  When we finally reached the mosque, my mother and a few of her aunts headed to the womens section, and my father took me to the mens section and told me to run to the restroom while he spread out his prayer rug and conversed with my moms uncle.  I cant remember the name of the mosque, but I recall how spacious and labyrinthine it was. One room with grand arches and vaulted ceilings led to another, and all of the rooms were so packed with people that pretty soon, I was lost. I was a frail little boy, too small for my age, and I was terrified of all the adults standing around me in prayer, towering over me with their eyes closed like solemn statues. I was running around frantically with a hand on my crotch, trying not to think about my bladder bursting, and somehow I found myself in a room with a lavish golden tomb, a gargantuan cube glittering beneath a green chandelier. People were gathered around the tomb, slumped against its crisscrossing bars, wailing and moaning as loudly as they could. Id never seen so many people crying with such passion. I knew this was  , the ritual mourning that Id seen on TV, but for some reason I wasnt convinced that these people were actually sad. My mother cried when my father shouted at her, but this type of crying didnt seem pained or anguished in any way. It felt overly fretful and hopeless, almost exaggerated. I tried to squeeze through the crowd and make my way out of the room, but as soon as I rounded the corner of the cube, I ran into a religious cleric and froze. The man was tall with a scraggly beard and a hefty turban that looked haphazardly plopped on his head. He was flicking his prayer beads, muttering something under his breath, and his jutting nose and beetling brows gave him the bellicose air of a vulture. He mustve been the quietest person in the room, and it was obvious from the way he glanced back and forth that he was judging everyone around him. People were flaunting their misery for him. Whoever could bemoan the death of the holy figure in the cube with utmost conviction was regarded as a  , a true believer, in his eyes. This entire spectacle was a crying contest that I hadnt signed up for, and the cleric noticed my lack of participation.  Whats your name, son? he crouched in front of me.  I told him and his face lit up.  Alhamdullilah, he squeezed my shoulder with a smile, as if I was a miniature version of the Prophet. What do you have to say to the Imam? he pointed inside the cube at a coffin bedecked with bouquets of flowers. I hunched my shoulders and winced. I gotta pee. The cleric frowned. You have to  ? There was a tug of authority in his voice, a hint of disappointment that made me feel ashamed. Id never spoken to a cleric before. I knew they were powerful people that I had to respect, but I also didnt want to lie to him, because lying was a sin. How about this? the cleric took off his turban and placed it on my head. This will give you some inspiration. I want you to close your eyes and think about what the Imam means to you and your family.  I closed my eyes like a good boy and tried to think about the Imam (I dont recall exactly which Imam it was) but the turban on my head, like an oversized cloud, made me feel like I was soaring through the sky, looking down on everything from above. I felt pressured to think of something profound to say, but the only thing that crossed my mind were images of lush meadows filled with delicate flowers that Id seen on TV. Those images would pop up during intermissions between programs, and they were always accompanied by melancholic music that was meant to encourage viewers to brood about the beauty of Gods creations. I imagined a gargantuan waterfall next to a grassy field, and all of that gushing water, flowing freely, sent a roil through my bladder. Next thing I knew, warmth was spreading through my pants, streaming down my leg, and I stiffened up all of a sudden and opened my eyes. The imam gave us water! I said. The clerics expression softened into a smile. His Holiness didnt invent water. But he did cup his hands so that the needy could drink. Did you know that? The cleric cupped his palms in front of me, and I imagined an arc of water spouting from my pants into his hands, creating a beautiful little fountain filled with yellow-tinged water, from which the needy could drink.  But what if the water was impure?  The cleric furrowed his brow. That would never happen! Nothing offered by an imam could ever be impure. There was something menacing about his confident voice. I could see him raising a cup of urine to my lips and telling me that it was the cleanest water anyone could drink, and what frightened me was that I would believe him, not because I didnt know any better, but because Id been conditioned to think that his lies were greater truths that escaped my understanding. And yet I knew for a fact that if he saw the puddle spreading through my pants, hed accuse me of desecrating the imams tomb, of defiling his holy presence, and Id have to be escorted out of the mosque.  In that moment, I recognized a grave contradiction: what applied to me, didnt apply to the cleric. He could never commit wrongdoing, because he was infallible. Even his false statements were truths, because only I could make a mistake. Only I could be impure and besmirch something.   was inviolable.  The turban felt uncomfortable on my head, like a mechanical device that was scanning my brain and manipulating my thoughts, so I handed it back to him and excused myself. I remember running out of the room as fast as I could, forgetting where I was going or what I was trying to do, because I was so disturbed. I wanted to get as far away from the cleric as possible. Shame coursed through me, and I felt like Id been duped or violated. Even after Id used the restroom and was washing my hands, I could feel the clerics gaze on my back, waiting to see whether Id clean my sullied pants before stepping out into the mosque. I spurted some hand soap on a tissue and wiped my pants, but no matter how much I scrubbed, it wasnt good enough. I still felt unclean, debauched in some unfathomable way, as if filth was congenital to my being. Parastou Forouhar,  , 2020. Permanent site-specific work in the city of Chur in Switzerland, white paint on asphalt, 960 qm That childhood memory fundamentally changed my prayer routine for many years to come. In August 1998, when my family and I moved to the U.S., the country of The Great Satan, I felt even more compelled to purify myself during   (ablutions.) For the first five years, we lived in my uncles house in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and my uncle used to complain to my parents that I spent way too much time in the bathroom. What the heck does he do in there? hed ask. For a while, my mother thought that I was masturbating (another filthy sin) but when I told her that I was washing up for prayer, she told me that I was taking it too far.  You dont need to be that clean, shed say. Its not good for you to keep scrubbing your skin with soap. But what if my thighs are dirty? Maybe I accidentally tinkled in my boxers at school or something. I had become obsessed with cleanliness. It wasnt so much germaphobia or a constant need to take showers, but rather my own prolonged version of   that I had to enact every day. I always felt icky and contaminated, as if little bugs were crawling up my legs, and Id mutter   every five seconds at school, asking God to forgive me for being in America, for sitting in class next to girls without veils and boys who always talked about sex.  I suffered greatly during my teenage years, because American culture was too chaotic and unpredictable to me; there was too much freedom, too much spontaneity, too many people living their lives based on their erratic whims and impulses. Nobody seemed to value discretion and modesty. Kids in high school would date one another and break up a week later, just because they felt like it, and teachers would praise students in class who raised their hands and expressed their opinions, as if fourteen-year-olds were entitled to believe whatever they wanted. Americans saw themselves as  , not as  , and that disconcerted me.  It took a long time for me to realize how deeply repressed I was, and why I had unwittingly internalized ideals that were detrimental to my personal growth. I was too ashamed to admit to myself that Id been heavily influenced by the paradoxical values of the clerical establishment, and that the reason I was struggling to flourish in America was because the lies and contradictions of the regime had suppressed my humanity, rendering me into a passive subject whod never acquired the taste for freedom, whod never associated happiness with self-will. It was only after I learned about the origins of the Islamic Republic that I came to terms with why I was the way I was.  Parastou Forouhar,   from the series \"Papillon Collection II,\" 2021. Digital drawing.  In Teheran in 2017, police brutally attacked demonstrators here. From the outset, the 1979 revolution in Iran was riddled with contradictions. The very concept of a  , in fact, was antithetical to the principles of the Islamic regime. According to Hannah Arendt,   used to simply refer to the movement of celestial bodies; for the longest time, it had no political connotations whatsoever. It only gained its political meaning after concepts like the inalienable rights of human beings and their values as citizens in a society was introduced into public consciousness. Ayatollah Khomeini, the founding father of the Islamic Republic, didnt believe in political revolutions or in subverting systems of power and privilege. He viewed humans as feeble subjects in need of guardianship, and he denounced ideas like personal liberty and natural rights as colonial constructs imposed upon Iran by the West. And yet what he cunningly devised was a revolutionary movement that ultimately ousted the Shah and catapulted him into power.  During the late 1970s, Iran was in complete disarray, and the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, knew that his days were numbered. According to British Ambassador Anthony Parsons, the Shahs aggressive economic and modernization plans had failed because he had ridden roughshod over traditional forces in Iran, creating major inequalities of wealth and appalling social conditions for the urban poor. In 1978, people were rioting in the streets, complaining that the Shah was a Western puppet whod squandered all of the countrys oil money, and that he'd reneged on all of his promises to improve society. CIA profiles of the Shah indicate that hed lost the support of the burgeoning middle-class because he believed that sharing power and democracy would impede Irans economic development. From a personal standpoint, he was also severely depressed. Hed been diagnosed with cancer, which made him irascible and indecisive, and he no longer had the mental fortitude to deal with the accusations that had been levelled at him his entire life: that he was a feckless leader compared to his father, that he was a wannabee dictator who didnt know how to dictate.  Parastou Forouhar,   from the series \"Papillon Collection II,\" 2021. Digital drawing.  Located near the city of Mahshahr in south Iran, police brutally attacked demonstrators here in 2019.  Meanwhile, Ayatollah Khomeini had been steadily gaining popularity in the country. The Shah had exiled him to Paris, but even from afar, Khomeini was crafty enough to survey the political landscape and recruit supporters from all sides of the spectrum. Hed set up a stellar team of intellectuals to become the public face of his movement, people like Bani-Sadr and Ebrahim Yazdi, and he was giving speeches calling for democracy and socio-economic freedom. Hed quote passages from the Quran that preached tolerance and open-mindedness, reciting verses like There is no coercion in matters of faith, and he told the German magazine   that our future society will be a free one, in which all elements of oppression, cruelty, and force will be destroyed. He even promised that women would be free in the selection of their activities, their future, and their clothing. His democratic disguise was so effective at concealing his despotic determination that even the U.S. embassy in Tehran concluded that his Islamic movement was far better organized, enlightened, and able to resist communism than its detractors would lead us to believe. Just about anyone that listened to him was immediately seduced by his rhetoric.  One of the people who saw through his disingenuousness was Ayatollah Kazem Shariatmadari, a pragmatic cleric who believed that the clergy should be kept out of governmental positions. He was always cordial with Khomeini, but behind the scenes he warned the U.S. that Khomeini was a radical leader who was developing a dangerous ideology called   (the guardianship of the jurist.)   was a theological concept inspired by Platos forms; it basically stated that the   were incapable of governing themselves, and that they needed the guardianship of a jurist, a philosopher who could transcend earthly conceptions and apprehend divine truths, like revelations in the   or the  . Essentially, Khomeini wanted to designate himself as an absolute ruler, as the only person who could convey Gods decrees.  Shariatmadari suffered terribly for his betrayal of Khomeini. Paramilitary forces stormed his house and ransacked his belongings, and Khomeini publicly humiliated him by making him apologize for his sins on national TV.  About six months after Khomeini returned to Iran to become the Supreme Leader, the American Embassy in Tehran admitted that their assessment of him had been a mistake. They said that Khomeini and a handful of other clerics were now making decisions on all matters of importance, and that any kind of rapport between Khomeini and the U.S. was virtually impossible, because he disdained the democratic values that hed originally championed. When they asked him about his contradictory beliefs, he casually replied that hed been employing  , the Shiite practice of dissimulation in the service of Islam.  The hostage crisis of 1979-1981 captured the worlds attention, cementing anti-Americanism as one of the central tenets of the Islamic Republic, and eventually, when people learned about the violence and the mass executions of just about anyone who opposed Khomeini, it became obvious that the Islamic Republic was going to become one of the most repressive regimes in human history. Parastou Forouhar,   from the series \"Papillon Collection II,\" 2023. Digital drawing  When I consider the current uprising in Iran, I feel conflicted and deeply disturbed in ways that sometimes seem inexplicable. The uprising began last September, after twenty-two-year-old Mahsa Amini was killed by the Morality Police for improper hijab, and for several months afterwards people all over the country flooded the streets, chanting Death to the Islamic Republic! and destroying signs and murals of the Supreme Leader. Women took off their hijabs in public and burned them in bonfires. People clashed with riot police (Basij members) throwing rocks and sticks at them, and many were beaten by batons and bruised by rubber bullets. The Basij blinded people by shooting pellets directly into their faces. Blindness became something of a phenomenon in Iran; people started posting pictures of themselves on social media, smiling and covering one eye with an ornate eyepatch or a flower, proudly displaying what theyd sacrificed for the revolution. Universities everywhere closed down for some time and students were encouraged to go fight for their rights. For the first time during the era of the Islamic Republic, people of all ethnicities seemed united; Persians, Kurds, Turks, Arabs, and Balochis all stood side by side against the regime.  A little while ago, the regime augmented its scare tactics by publicizing executions of protestors. Everyday there was news that somebody held in Evin (the infamous prison known for housing political dissidents) was going to be hung the next day, and their parents would upload tearful videos begging the regime to spare their childs life.  I remember my uncle quite well from my childhood days in Tehran. Although he wasnt particularly religious (he hardly ever prayed or fasted during Ramadan) he was always somewhat staid and reticent, preferring the low-key comforts of conformity. There are many people like him in the country, especially older folks and bazaaris (merchants) who complain that theyve been losing money, because rioters have broken into their stores. Whos gonna fix the butcher shops shattered window? my uncle apparently asked my cousin during a family get-together. The butcher obviously cant fix it. He doesnt have enough money. His store has been closed all week! My other uncle on my moms side, who works in education and oversees a few English-language schools, is also not in favor of overthrowing the regime, because hes always been a religious man. My fathers theory, however, is that hes only a strict Shiite because it benefits him. The clerics gave him a great job! my dad told me during Christmas break when I was visiting home. This guy runs an entire institution by himself, and all he has to do is report to the office once every few weeks and give the cleric sitting behind the desk some updates on how their schools are going. Thats about it. Shoot, Id be religious too if I had that job! But you dont think hes just pretending to be religious? I asked. You think he actually believes it? Of course he does! He has no reason to pretend. His beliefs literally made his entire life better. My uncles represent a category of Iranian people known as Qeshr-e Khakestari,   or  .   people are those who refuse to support the 2022 uprising, either because theyre traditionally oriented and vaguely religious, or because theyre strict Shiites who disagree with  , but are benefitting enough from it so as not to want to eradicate it. The chief problem facing the 2022 revolutionaries is that they dont know how to inspire   members to take to the streets against the regime. This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that the Iranian diaspora is vastly divided. An estimated 4 million Iranians live outside of the country, and for decades petty acrimonies and recriminations have caused great rifts in our community, leading to various factions vying for power.  Parastou Forouhar,   from the series \"Papillon Collection II,\" 2021. Digital drawing.  Haft-Tappe is a factory whose union plays a major role in the workers movement in Iran. On February 11th, some of the most well-known voices in the diaspora, including Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi and the vociferous womens rights activist Masih Alinejad, gathered in Georgetown University to discuss the future of democracy in Iran. Many members of the diaspora have lately been hashtagging #  on social media, endorsing Crown Prince Pahlavi as their representative to transition Iran from clerical rule to a secular democracy. Pahlavi has been handling this attention with shrewd nonchalance.  I have no interest in power, he told an interviewer on Manoto, a London-based Persian language channel. People only trust me as a leader because Im an unbiased source who assesses this turmoil from the outside. Some Iranians have criticized Pahlavis motives, because they interpret his nonchalance as a dubious attempt to divorce himself from his infamous last name and his fathers legacy, and thus gain power under a different brand. One of the main groups uttering this criticism is the MEK, , a politico-militant organization led by the notorious Maryam Rajavi. Over the past few decades, Rajavi has managed to develop strong connections with U.S. congressmen and powerful leaders in the West. On February 11th, an article in   stated that over 160 members of the U.S. Congress had put forth a resolution endorsing the MEK to bring about a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran. The problem with the MEK, however, is that theyre a brutally oppressive organization. Theyve been accused of cult-like behavior similar to the Church of Scientology, and theyre known for brainwashing, imprisoning, and sexually abusing their members. Defectors of the cult have mentioned torture cells and forced sterilizations of dissidents, and Rajavis close relationship with Trump officials and hawkish Republicans has made it abundantly clear that shes the wrong choice for Irans future.  The main challenge for Iranians now is to figure out how to instill a sense of unity in our community. We need to establish an organized plan for how to move forward. As of now, protests in Iran have largely died down, because tension and friction between various groups has resulted in inaction and indecision. No single group or organization has managed to recruit enough supporters under its banner, and history tells us that without unity and a concrete agenda the Islamic Republic will be impossible to overthrow. Ayatollah Khamenei and his murderous henchmen have spent decades bolstering their defensive capacities; the IRGC is one of the most robust and well-maintained terror institutions in the world. It controls an enormous portion of Irans economy. It has its own intelligence agency, its own space program, its own extraterritorial operations division, known as the Quds Force, which General Stanley McChrystal has described as a combination of the CIA and the Joint Special Operations Command. Its a heinous monster that continues to grow, but I have no doubt that millions of Iranians, standing arm in arm, could easily defeat it. We Persians have a rich history of justice and liberty. Our culture is filled with dazzling art and poetry that extols the virtues of humanity and exalts in how unfettered the human spirit can be when it sees itself in unison with all.  Though the words of the great leaders appear in a hundred different forms, since God is one and the Way is one, how can their words be different? Rumi asks. Though their teachings appear to contradict, their meaning is one. That   is human freedom, and it exists beyond words, beyond the rhetoric of political parties, beyond the contradictory teachings of the Islamic Republic. Its a oneness thats celebrated in various festivals throughout our culture, such as Chaharshanbe Suri, or  , where Iranians gather in the streets to set off fireworks and jump over bonfires, in order to honor the spirit of our Persian ancestors and feel united with them. That   is exactly what I wish Id known as a boy, so that I wouldnt have felt demoralized by the contradictions of the clerical establishment, and its also precisely what Iranians need to remember now, as they search for ways to overlook factional strife and enhance our revolution.

        "text": "Art by Chris Costan  Chris, we first got to know each other through a social media group that empowered artists; it was at a moment when the pandemic had disrupted our routines and appeared to offer an opening to new horizons. You were the main force within the group and asked me to join you. At the time, youd begun this terrific series of guerilla interventionsrogue public art events. What was your initial impetus? Did you have a prior history with this form?  In November 2019, right before Covid-19 descended upon us, I was on a  residency in Berlin at Lichtenberg Studios , where a single artist is given a live/work arrangement in a small museum. The invited artist is asked to contribute to or interact with the local community by creating an outward-facing public project. Public art was not within the scope of my work, so for a moment I was at a loss. But an idea eventually emerged. I needed to satisfy the residency request, but I also felt the need to say something meaningful that was of the moment. Id been feeling deeply disturbed by national and world events, a disturbance that had always been there but never felt quite so clearplus Id never been a politically-based artist. Immigration was an ever-dominant topic in the media, and so I decided to develop a project around the issue of skin color. It entailed applying twenty-five different colors of paint to 30 x 22-inch sheets of heavy rag paper, each representing the skin color of an individual I either saw or imagined I saw living in the Lichtenberg neighborhood of Berlin. I created accompanying texts, which I had translated into German, and placed them (in both English and German) on each piece. Each piece held a different skin color. Its a simple idea.  I pointed out that the   are the same as ones neighbor regardless of their skin color. I hoped if I installed these works about skin color around town, they might resonate with different communities and maybe even reach those that hold anti-immigration sentiments.  , 2019, Berlin, Germany Each day, after I completed a piece, I posted it on a surface in a public space. I used walls, doors, subway stations, store windows, fences. I watched the rain and weather begin to destroy the interventions, so I covered them with thin plastic wrap I found in the studio to protect them from the elements.  Eventually, each piece was either acquired or confiscated, usually leaving some kind of artifact behind. Great! I intended them as a way to communicate with random individuals in the public realm, and never had gallery walls in mindI wanted to be free of art world parameters, and to communicate in an abstract way, but also in an educational way. Im not sure where, if anywhere, this work fits in.  The idea of creating art that was time-based and performative is something that I believe emerged in the 1960s and 70s. Does it feel radical to you, as it did at the time? Is it ripe for our cultural context now?  I understand that what Im doing is not radical. What Im doing is making art and making it political. Id never engaged in making art that was overtly political; now I find the performative aspect of this work deeply satisfying, even exciting. These interventions afford me a holding pattern for living. The holding pattern involves engaging daily with the many predicaments were in. For instance, we cant make art if our environment isnt habitable.   Can you see a through line with your previous job in the fashion industry?  I was a color designer and trend specialist for a fashion brand for thirteen years, so I know that the color palette is a serious affair! As a color designer, I analyzed how and why people wear different clothing styles or a particular color at a given moment. As an informed spinner of tales about trending colors for merchandisers, designers, sales accounts, and sales associates, I used the Pantone Color Matching System (a standardized color-matching method) to give my colleagues a technical and representative sense of why I was recommending one color over another during a particular season.  Eventually, I left my job in fashion, but the Pantone concept stayed with me. It surfaced in Berlin as I entered the roiling existential waters of social and national discord. I began to use the Pantone format, but removed it from its intended uses and applied the system to issues with real gravitas. The Pantone Color Matching System began to serve as a way for me to express with urgency what many of us were (and are still) experiencing.    Did you get a response from people who saw and read the pieces? Did you feel it was successful according to your initial plan?  My expectations were high, at first. But the more I thought about public art, the more I realized art doesnt always change peoples minds. Much of the time, art viewers are like-minded and the artist is preaching to the choirthe artwork talks to its own instead of to the public.  But I still feel hopeful. My Lichtenberg project, despite the fact that it often entailed installing in the cold and wet, was oddly rewarding. The artists I interacted with in Berlin were interested and supportive of the project, and the residency culminated in the publication of a catalog to document it. Since each piece was signed and included contact information, an observant Berliner sent me a photograph of one of the still-standing Lichtenberg pieces a year later. It looked pretty good!   Why do you think your project wont change peoples minds? Its an unforced conversation, isnt it? Dont you hope that a stranger will happen upon a piece, read it, and then think about it? Theres a utopian aspect to these series that feels fresh today to me!  I always hope for a response. Id like to make multiples of some of them and post those in key places. Or maybe make a billboard. So yes, I guess utopian feels apropos! , 2020, New York, NY  , 2021, New York, NY  What got you started up again once you returned to the US?  Before I left Berlin, I realized I wanted to continue with the project in New York. I had more to say, and the interventions seemed full of potential. By May 2020, because of Covid-19, I was spending a lot of time upstate in Kingston. Ultimately, since public transportation wasnt safe, I was stuck there. I began to think about the causes of epidemics and the human impact on disease, including the ones that awaken after millennia of sleep. I was thinking about humanitys increasingly wide-ranging domination of the natural worldhow flora and fauna are being sacrificed on an altar of greed, wealth, and powerabout humanity as a threat to the natural world, and how Covid-19 fits in. We are a species that is destroying our home.  During the summer of 2020, I created twenty-three rogue events; each was painted redthe color of blood. I posted these interventions in public spaces in and around Kingston, including a large window in town in collaboration with  Purple Window Gallery  and another with  PaperGirl, a community art project originating in Berlin . I left most of these red interventions to be degraded by the elements. Next came A RIVER RUNS TO THEE (Rivers of the World, or the importance of water), a series of twenty-three interventions. After that came more specific themes and references. Left:  , 2021, New York, NY  Right:  , 2022, New York, NY , 2021, New York, NY Its interesting that you call them events. Do you think about them as appearing, having a life, and then degrading back into the earth? Or is the event about you making them and placing them? Or both? I think youve mentioned that you now photograph the pieces and take them home, rather than leave them to return to nature. Does that change how you think about the project?  Yes to all your questions. I do see them as events, since they take place and then (usually) disappear. Ive left forty-seven of these pieces in public places in Berlin, New York City, and Kingston. In fall 2020, I shifted gears and started photographing them in situ, and keeping the roughly eighty versions of the interventions I developed since then.   Some of the recent interventions seem not to be overtly political, more like discussions around a particular idea. For example, your recent Sea Fan of the Deep. Are you thinking about connecting stories and mythologies to large current issues? Or are the choices idiosyncratic? In other words: are you following your instincts rather than a logical agenda?  I relate to the word diary, a record of the thoughts and influences in an artists life. I am making analogies, relating ideas, stories and mythologies, to large current issues. But the choices are often idiosyncratic and I follow my instincts  As an observer of your work, Ive noticed quite a lot of wit in how you place the interventions. Some appear on shop windows, some are posed in a landscape (such as the garden in front of the Capitol building in DC). I noticed the compositional placement of one piece on a NYC bus shelter with a large fashion ad. You placed your piece on the item of clothing being advertised in a way so that the color matched! So, the particular site and context for each piece works with (not against) the subject matter.  , 2021 Kingston, NY   This series, which is increasingly important to my sanity, has resulted in some (rarely practiced!) self-exploration. The wit as you see it is part of art-making in general. The placement is often accidental, but also purposeful, perhaps even mystical, and often aesthetically in sync, all at the same time. When I leaf through the pieces, I wonder how such compositions even worked out, since Im usually in a somewhat stressful situation on the street, in a crowd, and exposed to the elements. Its never easy setting it up. Ive been caught on a surveillance camera, confronted, and chased away a few times. So, is placement unconscious? Is the formal composition and context a result of luck or skill? After years of art-making and day-job demands, you acquire some degree of expertise.   in situ, 2022, Sens, France , detail, 2022, Sens, France  Ive been musing over the idea that the great freedom of being an artist is that one can research and explore any subject. You seem to do that, while also connecting the dots to a larger picture, the personal as it relates to larger issues that are public, and seeing more connections than we do normally. In a way, I see your performance as a public service, and even without overtly political subject matter, the work is innately political.  I see the interventions as performative, educational, public serviceoriented (arguably), and also simply about making art. After working in the (commercial) world of fashion, the incredible difference between art and design is that as an artist you have total freedom.  Early in your career you made large-scale paintings, and now you make tabletop sculptures and collages. When youre not making Interventions, what other kinds of art-making are you involved with?   I need to be fully engaged to make art; moving in and out of working with different media like sculpture, collage, drawing, painting, is natural for me. I have a love of materialscolor, texture, patternand the irony, beauty, ugliness, humor, contradiction, and chaos in the world. So much to work with. Interventions incorporate these qualities as urgent, anguished, existential reminders that the effect we have on each other and on Nature can be horrendous, and even final. , 2022, Arezzo, Italy Chris Costan  has had solo exhibitions at Germans Van Eck Gallery, Windows on White Street, Avenue B Gallery, F.A.O.

        "text": "Art by Dietmar Busse Dietmar Busse,  , 2020  Customized silver gelatin photographic paper, 11 x 14 in Norah and Tara were fighting over egg whites. One of the residents had switched his breakfast preference to scrambled egg whites instead of regular eggs, and Norah, who never read the instructional cards, hadnt ordered any from the kitchen. The resident complained and the cook had called Tara. Tara got pissed because he had woken her up, and when she tried to tell Norah she was wrong, Norah began screaming.  Norahs stiff black uniform crinkled with the exaggerated movements that accompanied her shrill voice. Irina didnt like either of them, but Norah had taken first place on her who-to-avoid list. Norah had worked here for over forty years. She made bad jokes, broke personal-space barriers, tried to boss everyone around, and believed she was always right. Hence the egg-white fiasco.  Irina covered a yawn. She had been scheduled to work the morning shift, which meant she had been at the nursing home since 6 AM. It was now ten, and her eyes struggled to stay open as she looked around the room at the rest of her coworkers. Jaqueline stared at her shoes, James cleaned his glasses with his shirt, Maddy munched on a breakfast bar, and Clara stared out the window. Irina didnt know the others names, just their faces. They looked as tired as she felt.  Sam, the supervisor, broke Norah and Tara up. The meeting, if you could call it that, was over. Irina never understood the need for a daily meeting. All it consisted of was going over the menu, which everyone had a copy of anyway, and discussing the weather if it was snowing or pouring and someone had an issue getting to work on time. Also something that could be handled with a phone call. The sole purpose she could come up with was to give the illusion of importance, to sit down with the managers and have them nod along as someone vented about how the weekend shift people hadnt folded the napkins correctly or left the milk on the wrong shelf. Irina didnt get why people like Norah got so worked up over these matters. They all made minimum wage, so why complicate things?  Irina and Jaqueline worked the fourth-floor kitchen, Jaqueline behind the counter and Irina in the front. That was weird downstairs, Irina said as she waited for Jaqueline to finish scooping vanilla pudding into cups.  Norah needs to learn to shut the fuck up. Shes always trying to do other peoples jobs and shit.   I know. Whenever I see Im scheduled to work with her, I consider calling out. Yeah, and who cares about egg whites? Just fucking do it. Exactly. Jaqueline was the only other worker who was Irinas age, and they had bonded over their mutual dislike for the job. Jaqueline was saving up for an EMT course and couldnt wait to leave.  Norah doesnt know when to stop talking, Jaqueline said.  I stopped answering her and after a while she got the hint. But she still tries to tell me what to do, like last week she wanted me to clean the fridge. Hell no, no one wants to touch that nasty-ass fridge. They fell into a comfortable silence, and Irina finished preparing the trays, placing milk, ice cream, cake, pudding, and fruit on each one. Jaqueline served the main course, which looked and smelled like the crap they gave for hot lunch at elementary school. Greasy chicken that leaked highlighter-yellow fat, instant mashed potatoes, and watery boiled spinach. The residents who got that were lucky; the few unfortunate ones deemed as puree texture got the same thing but blended up. The different colored pastes congealed together and wobbled like Jell-O.  When the residents finished eating, Irina scraped the returned plates clean of leftover, chewed-up, spit-up, or untouched food, gagging at one particularly nasty plate covered in cranberry juice and milk with a soggy Band-Aid stuck to it. Jaqueline loaded the dishwasher as Irina disinfected the pan racks and stacked the dinner trays onto them. They were almost done when Norah came in with a Styrofoam food tray in her hands. Hi, Irina, hey, Jaqueline! Can you believe what happened earlier? Tara has no idea what shes talking about and that she speaks to me like I dont know what Im doing Jaqueline slammed the dishwasher shut. She has no right to, Norah continued as she sat down and opened her tray. But dont worry, I put her in her place. Norah spoke with her mouth full, exposing a blend of spinach and chicken. Irina draped protective plastic over the finished trays. Sam agreed with me, so thats all that matters. The clock read 2 PM, only half an hour left before Irinas shift ended. Why arent you eating? Have you eaten yet? Norah asked. No, Im gonna eat at home, Irina said.  You need to eat. Here. She waved at the leftover food Jaqueline had returned to the trolley from the downstairs kitchen. I never see you eat. Im good. Id rather eat at home.  But youre so skinny, such a long shift and not eating. She launched into another monologue. Norah was right about one thing; she never did see Irina eat. The thought of ingesting something linked to this place gave Irina a strange sense of panic. As if by eating, shed be accepting this part of her life, and somehow that meant she wouldnt be able to leave.  Hey, Norah, so I just finished for the day and have to make a phone call. Ill be right back, Irina said. Jaqueline glared at her, but she was already halfway to the door. Done so early, just like me! Norah jumped up from her chair. See how easy our lives are? She put her hands on her hips with an air of pride and happiness, as if she had a secret cheat code to life. Irina cringed as she speed-walked to the bathroom. Norahs ignorant joy, her lack of aspiration for anything better than cleaning up after others and working a repetitive cycle of minimum wage in a draining job made Irina angry. She locked the bathroom door and felt trapped. Maybe she wasnt angry, just frustrated and scared. Irina looked in the mirror. Her hair was hidden under a hairnet, her under-eye bags and skin imperfections showed because she didnt care enough to wear makeup to work, she was pale, and her body covered by the formless uniform. Embarrassment mixed in with her fear.  At what point in Norahs life, or in the lives of any of the people who had worked here for decades, had they given up on their dreams? How could they wake up every morning knowing that the rest of their lives would be spent wasting hours doing a job that, if you had a double, meant working from 6 AM to 6:30 PM? Did they go kicking and screaming, desperately trying to find another option before being weighed into compliance by the financial burden of children, an ill relative, or something like that? Or did they not notice, just rolled out of bed one day knowing that their time for change had passed?  She was terrified of ending up like Norah. Day after day after day of the same dead-end schedule. Always working, sacrificing time, and, in some cases, healthMaddy had blown out her back lifting a box of canned beans last yearand still struggling to make ends meet.  Whenever she clocked in, Irina was faced with reminders of how easy it would be for her to become one of them. It showed her first-hand what her life might become if she wasnt able to graduate, if her scholarship got taken away, if she didnt get an internship, or if she couldnt get into grad school. She had the urge to ask Norah what her dream had been when she was a child but held back, knowing that whatever it was, whoever she had once been, wasnt worth the agitation of speaking to who she was now.   Irina spent the rest of the shift hiding in the bathroom, stepping out during the last five minutes to throw off her uniform, shove it as far down into her bag as she could, and rip off her hairnet. In the basement, everyone crowded by the iPad, motionless, watching the seconds go by so they wouldnt waste a penny by clocking out a moment before 2:30. She nudged past them and into the storage room, where she took some water bottles and scavenged for ketchup and oatmeal. Sam was terrible at keeping track of inventory, so shed been doing a good chunk of her grocery shopping here. 2:33. She walked out of the storage room and clocked out at the deserted iPad.  The subway was delayed, and by the time she got off the F train at West 4th Street it was almost four. Washington Square hummed with midsummer energy. Children ran through the fountain, shooting water guns and wading after one another. Ice cream stands, artists, and street performers lined the pathways, and a mix of voices, hip-hop, and barking flooded Irinas ears. A man played a familiar tune on a light-up keyboard, and a homeless woman danced a strange, offbeat jig to it. A little boy on a scooter nearly collided with a group of finance bros who refused to take off their suit jackets despite the heat.  Irina entered her building and walked around the marble staircase to the hidden basement stairs beneath it. At the bottom, she passed the gaping doorway of the boiler room on her way down the paint-smelling hallway that ended with the door to her dads apartment.  Across from the front door was her dads room. It was wide, with space to fit a sofa, bed, and desk. Despite this, the space felt cramped. The only window was a small sliver in the top corner of the room, too high to reach without a ladder. The door was covered in drill marks Irina had made when she was a kid and had gotten into her dads toolbox. He had since covered the door and surrounding wall area in notes, half Polish, half English, words and numbers that seemed meaningless but served as reminders of things he needed to do.  The short hallway covered in tan and green tiles housed the buildings meters and an abandoned fridge from the 50s, which her dad had converted into a huge toolbox. The bathroom was to the left of the entryway that opened into the kitchen. It was cheaply renovated, except for the ancient gas stove that required long matches to ignite. A peeling white island counter separated the kitchen from the living and dining area, which consisted of a worn brown sofa and round table. To the right of the table was Irinas bedroom.  About three years ago, she had watched a girl named Kate on YouTube and redone her entire room. Kate talked about the importance of making your space comfortable, clean, and productive, and gave tips on how to achieve this. Irina listened and turned her childhood bedroom, previously decorated with random furniture other people in the building had discarded, into her own safe space. She worked as a babysitter back then and saved for over a year to buy minimalist Ikea furniture, fairy lights, desk and floor lamps, Scandinavian prints, a fluffy rug, and bedsheets with a delicate pastel purple pattern. Whenever she entered her room, she felt relief, no matter what type of day she had had.  Irina grabbed her towel and padded to the bathroom. Water splashed off of her and onto the tub in an irregular rhythm, clearing her head and filling the room with steam that fought off the persistent basement chill. The tension that had accumulated in her forehead and shoulders over the course of the day began to release.  She applied a pre-shampoo hair mask and let it sit as she exfoliated the layer of skin that had been exposed to the nursing home, the messy food scraps, and itchy uniform. With every scrub, she felt closer to herself. Her skin gleamed as she rinsed off the hair mask, shampooed, conditioned, and washed her face, rubbing in upward motions to reduce the under-eye bags that had gathered in protest of her early shift.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2021  Customized silver gelatin photographic paper, 11 x 14 in Feeling fresh, clean, and restored, she bundled her hair in a towel and put on a robe. She sat down at her desk, switched on the lighted mirror, and applied her makeup. Irinas hands moved across her face on their own, repeating the motions they had memorized from years of practice. She watched her eye bags vanish, cheekbones pop, skin even out and take on a sun-kissed glow along with healthy, rosy cheeks. Her almond-shaped eyes elongated with two catlike strokes, and her eyelashes extended. Her lips became fuller and more defined with a rose-nude color a couple of shades darker than their natural tone.  Her hair dried in waves that she accentuated by brushing in honey-infused hair oil that smelled candied and decadent. She adorned her ears with pearl drop earrings Marcus had bought for her birthday and snapped on a silver necklace that complemented her off-the-shoulder black dress. She readied her purse and sprayed on perfume.  Before leaving, she sat back down in front of the mirror. Her heart fluttered, and she closed her eyes, taking three deep breaths. She became aware of the familiar knot in her stomach, the slight unsteadiness of her hands, and the perspiration gathering under her arms. She took three more deep breaths and squeezed every muscle in her body, counted to ten, then let them fall limp. Three more breaths, and she felt better. Irina opened her eyes and saw them reflected back in the mirror. She was a different person from the girl in the mirror at work. That girl was exhausted, unkempt, pasty, and had an air of sad, hopeless irritation. But this girl looked as though she had everything. She could be a lawyer, going out to celebrate after a long week of winning cases, a businesswoman who had just closed a huge deal, an editor for a successful magazine. Maybe she worked at a museum, or was an art consultant to one of New York Citys many millionaires. She had long, gleaming hair, playful eyes, a happy but serious expression, and exuded confidence. Irina touched the girls face, knowing she wasnt really herself but wishing that she was. She was the face that Irina presented to the world, the girl shed created in seventh grade and watched grow ever since.  When Irina was little, she lived in Queens, and her dad worked as a handyman in the building across the street from their current Manhattan apartment. When he heard of an opening for a superintendent position in this building that came with a free apartment on Fifth Avenue, he took it. This way, he saved on rent, could keep both jobs because they were located so close to one another, and Irina was in the desirable District 2 school zone, just in time to transfer to the nearby elementary school at the start of second grade. Every night hed yell at her to do practice tests for the standardized New York state exams that decided what middle school shed get into. Irina listened and got perfect scores.  In middle school, her dad found out she was smarter than the average kid, and he pounced on that. She didnt have time to relax between school, homework, his extra homework, and more test prep for the next set of standardized tests that would determine what high school she attended. After a while, he didnt have to nag Irina anymore. Shed internalized the importance of getting straight As, and it became her only focus. She spent her weekends at home studying, quizzing herself on vocab words no one used in real life, and timing herself solving math equations.  That was also when Irina created this girl, the one she put on before school and shed when she came home. Her name was Ella. Ellas father was a banker, and her mother was an elusive businesswoman who lived in Boston. Ella always smiled, was well put together, and never let anything slip out of her control. She was the girl who participated in class, wrote perfect papers, the girl boys asked out to school dances, and the girl who got into one of the best high schools in the city.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2021  Customized photo pape collage, 11 x 14 in In high school, Ella fit right in. She attended Alices housewarming and didnt act surprised by her double penthouse apartment overlooking Central Park. Nor was she fazed when the girls who invited her out to lunch spent thirty dollars on sandwiches and iced coffee every day. Ella had quick excuses, casual explanations, and was designed to observe everyone and make herself blend in. Ella applied to and received university scholarships, studied well in advance for exams, submitted assignments she knew would get an A, and had an inner discipline pushing her forward. No one, except Irinas friend Diana, knew the truth.  Irina had created Ella to avoid the anxiety of a classmate asking what her parents did for a living, right after stating that theirs were surgeons, lawyers, or something of the sort. She dreaded the silence that went on just a beat too long, followed by the awkward Oh, thats cool, and quick subject change whenever she told the truth. After that, her peers treated Irina differently. It was a subtle change. No one was rude or made fun of her, but she was no longer invited to meet up after class or to sleepovers. When they realized she wasnt like them they began treating her as such, polite but distant.  Ella was made to help Irina fit in. At that age, thats all Irina had cared about. She never thought that Ella would become an integral part of her life or that shed grow jealous of her. Ella was Irinas greatest asset, and she planned to use her until she became her. Until then, Irina was caught somewhere between the two girls shed seen in mirrors today. She was a rising senior studying engineering and worked at the nursing home. She wasnt wealthy, but most of her friends and her boyfriend were, allowing her a glimpse into their lives. She didnt pay rent, so she could afford to go out, and Marcus usually paid anyway. She lived in one of the most desirable neighborhoods in Manhattan, but only because her dad was the super. She was caught in the middle.  Ella smiled through the mirror. Irina ran her fingers through Ellas hair, adjusted her earrings, and got up. She emerged from under the city, ready to partake in its Friday night activities.  She crossed the street and paused by Claudette to text Diana. A group of drunk women sat outside, laughing and wooing and taking photos of their food. Their waitress, a pretty girl around Irinas age, came up to the table and started clearing empty glasses while taking orders and refill requests. Irina had seen her working before, and each time contemplated saying hi since she recognized her from campus. She was friends with Naomi, a girl from Irinas computer science elective. The waitress looked up and made eye contact with Irina. Did she recognize her? They smiled at one another before looking away, neither one of them wanting to come off weird. Mila! Table twelve is asking for you, someone called from inside the restaurant. Mila, arms full of empty glasses, hurried inside. As Irina passed the restaurant on her way to Union Square, she remembered the anxiety she had felt when Marcus, after walking her home one night, had suggested that they get brunch or dinner at Claudette. Irina had sputtered and almost lost her Ella faade. What if during brunch, her dad passed by on his lunch break? Or saw them at dinner when he clocked out? One look at his work uniform, and Marcus would know she had lied about him being a banker. Nah, this place is overrated. Ive been twice, and both times it sucked. The staff is super rude, especially the hostess. I had a reservation, and she made me wait an extra forty-five minutes to get seated.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2021  Customized silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 50 in Later that night, Irina sat in the shower and cried. Nothing had happened, Ella and her secret were safe, but instead of relief, Irina had felt sadness. Up until then, Ella had been a harmless invention. One without any sacrifices or drawbacks, something Irina had been in full control over. A charade she could drop at any time if she wanted to because none of the people she deceived mattered. But after that night, Irina realized that she   just drop the Ella act, not unless she was ready to lose Marcus and his friends that had become her own. And on top of that, Irina had felt guilt for wanting to hide from her dad. He had worked hard and accomplished so much in his life. How horrible would he feel if he knew that she was embarrassed of him? And what if he already knew? Whenever she and Marcus or their friends were in her area, Irina was hypervigilant for her dad, but what if she had missed him and hed seen her but decided not to say hi? Decided to pretend he was a stranger because, in an unspoken way, he could tell that this was what Irina wanted? Had one of her friends given him a snooty look? Had he noticed that in the past, she would sometimes meet him after work, and theyd stroll around Washington Square or get an early dinner, but now she avoided going anywhere with him out of fear of being recognized? Despite being in the shower, Irina had felt disgusting, and no amount of scrubbing could have changed that. Irinas phone pinged and brought her back to the present.   Diana wrote.  Irina walked across the stone pavement where the farmers market stood during the day. The smell of frying meat from a halal cart fanned by as she passed the Gandhi statue. The cart was the first in a string of vendors, including a caricaturist with sketches of people donning exaggerated noses or ears hanging around him, a used-books stand, and a foldout table from which an old man sold an array of worn shoes and jewelry.  People weaved past each other, pushing and shoving the occasional straggler. The pungent smoke from incense stands in front of Whole Foods reached her. Someone chuckled, a low heartfelt sound that resonated over the rest of the streets chatter. She twisted around. A large man with dreadlocks and a red cap had just beaten someone in a game of chess set up on a plastic fruit box. She watched people and cars blur into one another, doing her best to keep her mind blank, until Diana tapped her shoulder.  Hey, Irina, she said and leaned over for a hug.  Hey, what took you so long?  My mom needed me to pick up Zach from after-school. I guess they were finger-painting today because he was covered in that crap. Did you get it off him? Yeah, but I dont know about the clothes. I just put them in the washer.  Youll probably have to toss them. Paint never came off of me when I was a kid.  Its my moms problem now. They strolled further into Union Square Park and sat on the rounded steps. Diana pulled out two bottles of raspberry Sparkling Ice.  Thanks. Did you bring the shooters too? Irina asked, opening the bottle and pouring out about a quarter.  Yeah, theyre in my bag. We had a lot left over from last week. She placed her purse, filled with white rum shooters, between them. Irina cast a quick look around to make sure no cops were nearby before pouring three shots into each bottle. They took their first sips, crinkling their noses as the rum burned their throats.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2020 Mixed media on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 56 in  Whos gonna be at the rooftop tonight? Diana asked.  Marcus, obviously, Kathleen, Asher, Tyler, Gunther, and Sasha. Irina nudged Diana. I made sure Marcus invited Tyler. Maybe tonight something will finally happen between you two.  I hope so. He flirts with me every time we hang out but hasnt hit me up. Weird, but Marcus said Tyler likes you. Maybe hes shy or really busy with that internship. Diana shrugged and took a sip of her drink. Just wait and see. Every guy is different. Two men brought a jump rope, and people lined up, taking turns jumping through it. In between jumpers, one of the guys started up his portable radio and placed it next to a bucket marked Donations. Beyoncs Single Ladies blared from the speaker, enticing more people to join the jump rope line. Irina took another shooter and swallowed it without the mixer.  Didnt have a good shift? Diana asked.  Not really. I hate being there full-time. It makes me want school to start again. Same. Without school my mom sees me as a free nanny. Diana had been raised by a single mom who worked as a cleaning lady. They used to live in the same building back in Queens. She had four younger siblings, Zach, Josh, Dave, and Lily, and they all had to cram into a one-bedroom walk-up. Whenever Irina came over, it was chaos. Dianas siblings would scream and chase each other around the apartment, leave food, markers, and clothes all over the floor and furniture, cry, and occasionally knock over a lamp or vase.  Shit, yeah. Your siblings can be a  . Irina pulled out a pack of Camels and offered it to Diana.  Theyre fucking with my study time. She took a drag from her cigarette and put her hand to her forehead. Youre always welcome to study at mine. Thanks. Its not just that, though. Three extra years in school is a long time, and Ill be in so much debt. Diana trailed off and looked away.  Seriously, just come over whenever you want some peace and quiet. You wont be living with your family forever.  Easy for you to say.  Irina shot an irritated look at Diana. She hated when Diana got in these moods. Diana had been talking about moving out ever since she was a freshman in high school, and Irina had no trouble imagining why. Especially since her need for personal space and time to herself would go up when she started law school and her workload increased. Thats why shed let Irina introduce her to Marcuss friends. Shed previously refused because she didnt want to make up her own version of an Ella, but once she saw how quickly Irina got Marcus to ask her to move in with him, she changed her mind.  Diana didnt understand why Irina wanted to move out of her dads place. She was an only child, and the apartment was quiet and well-located. These things were true, but Irina was motivated by something else. Shed grown up surrounded by people who had more than her. More clothes, more bags, more shoes, and as she got older, she realized, more freedom. They would escape the cold winter months in Aruba or the Bahamas. They could go out to dinner and drink wine by the bottle without worrying about the check. They could go shopping with the confidence that anything they wanted was theirs. They lived in high apartments with large windows that they loved and didnt have to settle for a basement because it was what they could afford.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2020 Mixed media on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 56 in  Irina wanted a job that paid enough to do all of those things and more. One that shone with the possibilities of a lucrative future. She wanted an apartment up in the clouds, the vacations where she wouldnt fly economy and be sandwiched between a fat person and a bawling baby, the dinners, bars, and parties. She could wait one year until she graduated, then another two for her masters, assuming she could afford to do it full-time, and then a few more years to build her way up in some company to reach these goals, but that took a lot of patience and living not in her desired style in the meantime. This is where Marcus and moving in with him became important. And to do that, Irina needed Ella, who already fit in with the people she wanted to become and would help her make their lifestyle her reality.  Sorry, Im just annoyed with everything today, Diana said.  Yeah, I get it. Howd you make Marcus ask you to move in with him so soon?  Just say what he wants to hear, and his imagination will do the rest. Irina was going to move in with Marcus at the end of next month when his roommate left for a job in California. Diana handed Irina the cigarette butt, and she took a final puff before rubbing it out. I think it helped that we met in class. Really? Yeah, because we spent lots of time together before he asked me out. Plus, we always had something to talk about. Irina had met Marcus during the first week of junior year. He had sat in the front row with an intense, almost angry expression, fingers ready to start pounding on his keyboard even though the professor was just beginning to set up. He seemed as though he had something to prove, and Irina thought he was cute underneath his scowl. She sat next to him, had Ella introduce herself, and asked if he was alright. He said he was nervous, and she tried to make him feel better and offered to help him if he ever needed it. This loosened him up, and they became seat buddies.  Eventually he did need help, and they spent hours at the university coffee shop studying. After the exam, coffee turned into drinks, drinks into dinner, dinner into sleepovers, and then he asked her to be his girlfriend. About a month into their relationship, he broke down over a bad quiz score. Irina hadnt understood his reaction. It wasnt worth that much, and he could easily make it up. Thats when he told her that his father was the CEO of one of the top engineering firms in the city, and he felt as though he had to live up to his expectations.  After that, their relationship took on a new meaning. Irina had the image of her dad, always working, coming home at night after his two jobs, and crumpling up on the sofa only to get up and do the same thing all over again. Working at the nursing home helped her understand just how much he had given up for her to have a fighting chance. What she hated and wanted to run from, he ran straight into, all for her. She knew grades could get her places, but not as far as connections. Dating Marcus became more than just seeing a guy she had a crush on. It became part of her plan. Just as she worked to excel at school, she worked to excel as his girlfriend. She couldnt let an opportunity like Marcus slip through her fingers.  Irina had told Diana all of this, and although Diana never said anything out loud, she seemed to hold some resentment towards Irina and Marcuss relationship. She thought Irina was using him. She dismissed the detail that they were already dating when Irina found out who his dad was. Diana believed that Irina was searching for anyone with good connections and that if Marcus hadnt been what she had hoped, she would have found someone else. But Irina had liked Marcus before knowing anything, and if the opportunities he had that might help her someday were an incentive to work hard at their relationship, how was that a bad thing? It simply meant that he got a girlfriend who put time and effort into the relationship and wanted to have a future with him.   Dietmar Busse,  , 2020 Mixed media on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 56 in  Okay, well Tyler and I dont even go to the same school. What if theres someone from there hes hung up on? He probably would have told Marcus if there was, Irina said and lit another cigarette.  I dont know. This whole thing seems unreliable. You dont wanna go tonight? No, I do. I only Then go up to Tyler knowing youre the hottest bitch hes   talked to, believe it, and so will he. If you think youre gonna fuck up, then you will. So, dont think it. Yeah, fuck. Youre right. They watched a woman take off her high heels and throw herself into the whirling jump rope. What about you? Arent you worried Marcus will want to meet your dad once you move in? He already introduced you to his family. Wont he expect the same? I told him my dad was super strict and doesnt want me dating until Im done with school. Thatll hold me over until graduation. Then Ill figure it out. Irina downed the remainder of the rum-and-sparkling-water mixture. Keeping Marcus from meeting my dad hasnt been that hard. I feel like having a strict parent is a pretty simple explanation to keep him and our guy friends away. Its the girls that are the issue. Whatve you been telling them all this time? Just that because my dad is so strict, we wouldnt be able to drink or pregame at mine, or that if he heard us talking about boys or going out, then Id get in trouble, and that he likes to come home from work to a quiet house, stuff like that. Seems like a lot of work, Diana said and stood up. Where are we meeting them?  Dear Irving on Hudson, its a rooftop on 40th.  Irina spotted Marcus across the lounge, surrounded by Kathleen, Asher, Tyler, Gunther, and Sasha. She fixed her smile, relaxed her eyebrows, and strode further into the dim amber and gold room. Abstract gold chandeliers leaked muted yellow light, casting shadows across faces. Sasha took a selfie with Kathleen, once with flash and once without. Asher jumped in the back of it, sticking out his tongue. Gunther had his hand on Marcuss shoulder and balanced a half-empty drink on the edge of the small, circular table in front of them. Tyler reclined into the burnt-orange sofa, eyes glazed, and rubbed his head as he focused on the view outside. Tylers alone right now. You gotta talk to him, Irina said to Diana.  He seems pretty drunk. The lightweight of the group. Irina laughed. Gunther noticed Diana and Irina first. There they are! He took his hand off Marcuss shoulder and came close to spilling his drink. Marcus smiled and got up. Hey, I missed you, he said and hugged Irina before making room on the sofa.  Diana and I got caught up at that little bar you told me to check out, Slowly Shirley. Did you guys like it? It was fun. The whole speakeasy vibe was cool. You were right, I did love the Village Bicycle drink. I knew youd like it, he said and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. Lets go there together next weekend? I dont know about next weekend, Marcus trailed off, his eyes focused on hers, and a smile began to twitch at the corners of his mouth.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2022  Analog darkroom chemicals and retouch inks on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 40 in  Why? Whats next weekend?  We might want to go somewhere a bit more He was cut off by the waiter.  Can I get you anything, miss? Yes, Ill have the Marcus handed Irina the menu, and she hovered her finger across the cocktail list. The 808 State, please.  And Ill take another one of these, Marcus said, pointing to his glass.  Another Balto Old-Fashioned? the waiter asked, and Marcus nodded. The waiter turned away, and before Irina had the chance to ask Marcus what was so special about next weekend, Kathleen hopped over from the other sofa.  What took you and Diana so long? I couldnt wait to tell everyone, so they already know, but my parents are being placed in Buenos Aires in a few months. Kathleens voice slurred the ends of each word, but her eyes sparkled, and a genuine smile extended across her face.  No way, thats awesome.  I know. Im so excited! Were gonna have the best time. She opened her arms up to the group. Youre all invited to visit me in Buenos Aires.  If its anything like their New Delhi assignment, Im so in, Sasha said. Kathleens parents were both diplomats for the US government, and every three years, they were placed in a different city around the world. Kathleen had been born in Seattle but spent her childhood in Kyiv, Rome, Minsk, Cape Town, and Tokyo. The stories she had were insane. She moved to the city for undergrad and was now working at the UN.  Itll be better, Kathleen said. This time, you have to come. I cant believe you couldnt make it out to New Delhi, she said to Irina.  I know, Im still upset about that, but I couldnt miss my cousins wedding. We have three years for Argentina. Im sure itll work out. The truth is that her cousin had gotten married at that time, but it was a quick family ceremony upstate that was over within the span of a single weekend, but shed milked it. No way she could afford a flight to New Delhi.  I bet the girls are hot there. I cant wait for one of them to help me perfect my Spanish, Asher said. Sasha, who refused to admit that she had a thing for Asher, slapped his arm. Dont worry, baby. You know youll always be my number one. He winked at Sasha, who rolled her eyes. Wed be going there to spend time together as a group, not to have you run around after anything with a heartbeat.  Shit, Sasha, chill, Tyler said, looking up from his conversation with Diana. Irina grinned at Diana in a way that asked,   She signaled that he was.  Shes kinda right, Asher, Marcus chimed in. You just told me how much you blew in Vegas last week. You gotta be more careful. You guys are all boring as fuck. Asher called the waiter over. Lets get a round of shots. Tequila. The waiter nodded. Thatll help you guys loosen up. Wait, but I have to catch up on some work tomorrow, Tyler said. Tyler interned at Goldman Sachs and never stopped reminding the group about how much work it was.  Its a Friday night. Youll be fine, dont worry about it, Gunther said.  Yeah, cmon. Diana, get him to relax, will you? Asher said.  How was work today? Marcus asked, turning his attention away from the group and back to Irina.  It was okay, nothing crazy. I had a few students who needed help bringing up their math and logical reasoning SAT sections. I wanted to make sure they got everything right, so it took up some time. She had told Marcus, as well as everyone else except Diana, that she tutored high schoolers to explain the hours she spent at the nursing home. It was a good cover-up, and since she had been a tutor in the past, before the small Chinatown-based company she worked for went bankrupt, it didnt feel as fake as a total lie would.  Im sure you nailed it. Theyre lucky to have your help. I still cant believe how you managed to get a near-full fucking ride. Its unheard of. Guess I got lucky. Marcus took her hand between his and squeezed it. That excited glint from earlier returned to his eyes. The waiter brought the shots, and everyone clinked them together against the skyline. Marcus tapped his glass a second time just into Irinas. She nestled into the nook between Marcuss chest and arm as he fiddled with her hair. Tyler and Dianas heads were close together, their expressions animated, deep in their own world, having a conversation she would tell Irina about tomorrow. Sasha and Asher took another shot together as Kathleen and Gunther exchanged knowing glances. Kathleen pinched Sasha, who blushed and looked at Irina before starting to giggle. Asher got up to go to the bar, unable to get the waiters attention from across the room. When he was gone, Irina asked Sasha if she was ready to admit she liked him. Sasha turned red.  Maybe I do. She paused. But hes such a fucking asshole.  He is, but if you like him, you should tell him. Youre not some random girl. They talked a bit more about whether or not Sasha should tell Asher her feelings and debated if it would ruin their friendship, make the group dynamic awkward, and questioned if Asher was ready to consider a relationship.  At some point during the conversation, all the alcohol hit Irina. She was drunk, but not obvious, belligerent, or sloppy drunk. She was relaxed, collected, and spoke clearly, surrendering control to the trancelike state where what she said made sense, but she forgot the words she spoke the moment they seeped out of her mouth. She hoped she wasnt repeating herself.  A man with slick black hair and his shirt unbuttoned too low stood by the bar with a woman who threw her head back laughing. Two women in navy suits whispered to each other at a table, a girl with curly hair, a tan dress, and a crown that read Birthday Girl posed with her friends for a photo, and six guys ate chicken wings while sipping beers and slapping one another on the back in some kind of agreement. Other people swarmed around the bar, resting at tables and perching on chairs, talking, drinking, and staring at the view. They began to merge, becoming nothing more than a dynamic blob of sharp suits, open collars, leather dress shoes, sweet and tangy perfume, silky dresses, figure-hugging skirts, lacquered high heels, clinking glasses, and the faint smell of cigarettes that tumbled around Irinas peripheral vision.  From this congealed group, she began to feel peoples eyes. They tore into her, accused her, peeled off her disguise, ripped Ella away from her, and exposed that she didnt belong here. The women in navy suits were whispering about Irina, and the slick black-haired man had figured out her secret and told the woman he was with, and she laughed at Irinas expense. Birthday girl told her girlfriends how she had known something was off about Irina the second she walked in. Everyone knew, and they were closing in on her. The sound of silverware against plates, the scuffle of shoes on the floor, and the thump of the music were suffocating. She sipped her drink and heard herself agree with something Marcus said, and he drew her away from Sasha.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2022  Analog darkroom chemicals and retouch inks on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 40 in  Marcuss brown eyes felt safe amidst the sea of strangers accusations. His mouth moved, and he led Irina onto the outdoor terrace. He pulled out a chair, and as she sat down, he said hed be back in a second because he had forgotten their drinks inside.  The warm night air helped to steady the world and calm Irina. No one knew she didnt belong here. Ella had made sure of that. It was Ella who had spoken to Sasha, followed Marcus outside, and now sat at this table. Irina glanced past the glass doors to the burnt-orange sofas with the rest of her friends. Would they be her friends if they knew Irina instead of Ella? How would they react if she went in there and told them she lived in a basement, that her dad wasnt a banker but a super, that she was a lunch lady at a nursing home, and that her mom, the Boston businesswoman, was actually a drunk that she hadnt heard from in over a year? Would Kathleen still gush about going to Buenos Aires? Would Sasha confide her crush on Asher? Would Gunther, Asher, and Tyler want her around? What about Marcus? He held his drink in one hand and Irinas in the other and stood over everyone, saying something to Kathleen. Would he still want to date her? Move in with her? Or would he see her differently? Consider her not good enough? Someone he shouldnt have had brought home to his parents, someone to hide. They all laughed and drank with ease. Their motions fluid and easy. Sasha smirked and then covered a snort with her hand as her eyes scrunched together. Asher grumbled as he spat out a cherry stem, and Gunther held up his tied stem with triumph. Marcus spoke to Tyler and Diana, his words making them smile. A tug of jealousy pulled somewhere deep within Irinas chest. None of them had to pretend. They were the same people here as they would be when they got home at the end of the night. They werent putting on a show, slipping in and out of character. They just existed. Her eyes switched focus to her reflection in the glass. Ella gazed back at her, just as serene and natural as the rest of them. But Irina knew that wasnt true, and that secret weighed her down. Marcus stepped away from the others, and Irina snapped her head away from the windows. Marcus came up to the table. Irina heard Ella speak, her voice smooth and calm, happy and reassuring. Marcuss brown hair came to life in the wind, specks of red light from the lamp by their table mixing in with it, making it look like hed gotten a funny dye job. She focused on his facial features, deep-set eyes, strong Roman nose, slight stubble, and was filled with a sense of security. She held his hand tighter and realized she never wanted to let go.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2022  Analog darkroom chemicals and retouch inks on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 40 in  Irinas cheeks burned against the breeze, and she reached for her drink. It was bitter and left an icy trail as it snaked down her throat. She shivered back into reality and took another steadying sip. Marcus intertwined his fingers with hers and brought her hand up to kiss it. She smiled, tracing small circles on his hand with her thumb. Guess what Sasha told me in there, Irina said.  That she likes Asher? Its so obvious, isnt it?  Do you think Asher knows? Marcus asked.  Nah, hes the least observant person Ive ever met. She could full-on make out with him, and he still wouldnt get it. Well, good luck to them. I wont tell Asher anything, dont worry. Of course not, and dont tell Sasha I told you how she feels. Since theyd started dating, they had a little gossip pact. Whatever they said to each other, even if it was about their friends, stayed between them. Sometimes theyd even place bets on things like if Kathleen would give Diana back her belt within the next two weeks or for how long Gunther could get away with stealing his bosss protein bars from the office kitchen.  I bet shell tell him by the end of summer, Marcus said.  I think shell wait. Why? Ashers with a new girl every week in the summer. Shell see enough of that and reconsider. Or itll push her to confess sooner. Okay, I bet shell tell him after summer, around October or November. Irina held out her hand, and Marcus shook it. Do we realistically even want them to get together? Ashers great as a friend but dating him seems awful. Yeah, he doesnt make the smartest choices. Like his Vegas trip was wild, he wouldnt even tell me how much he lost or what he did, Irina said.  Upwards of 10K, and a good chunk of that went to strippers. A breeze swept past Irinas face, bringing with it the smell of alcohol and someones old-lady perfume.  Good luck, Sasha.  You havent been to Vegas, right?  No, not yet.  Marcus let the smile that had been itching at the corners of his mouth extend across his face, dimpling his left cheek.  What? I can tell youre hiding something. Irina grinned and leaned in closer to him, remembering that he had something he wanted to tell her.  I got us tickets for next weekend. We leave on Friday and fly back Sunday night. No way, youre fucking with me. Im serious. You can be my good-luck charm. I cant lose when youre around.  Dont jinx it, she said and put the hand he wasnt already holding on top of his. Id love to go with you. Her heart thudded with excitement. Whats the occasion?  I thought it would be a great place to celebrate. Marcuss eyes watched hers in anticipation. Irinas mind began to race with possibilities. Was his roommate moving out sooner than planned? Did he adopt a puppy? Or a cat? Hed been talking about getting a pet. What are we celebrating? Well, my dad liked you a lot back when I introduced you guys, so I showed him your rsum. He was impressed and decided to take both of us on as interns next semester. Youll still have to interview, but its just for show. We got it, Marcus said. Irinas breath caught in her throat. Shed been applying to internships like crazy, along with everyone else in their program. She had hoped that Marcus would offer to have his dad put in a good word or write a letter of recommendation, but she never imagined hed get his dad to hire her like this.  Holy shit, Marcus, thats amazing! Thank you. I dont know what to say. Honestly, this is huge. Tears began to well up in her eyes, and she blinked them away. Everything was falling into place. All her planning and effort had amounted to this. With an elite internship and Marcuss dad as a supervisor, any engineering graduate program would be happy to accept her. Are you sure your dad is okay with this? Yes, of course. I told him how you helped me study and how smart you are. You get stuff right away that takes me days to understand. Youre gonna be great.  Thank you. This is insane. No, my dad would be insane not to hire you. He signaled to the waiter to get another round. Marcus slipped into excited talk about the details of the internship and what he wanted to do in Vegas. Theres no one Id rather be going with, he said.   Me too, were gonna have the best time. He continued making plans. Irina had Ella match his emotions, mirroring back his admiration and love so he would think they were her own. She was in awe that everything had worked out as she had wanted. She pictured her dads face when she would break the good news to him. Hed be proud, and shed get to see that look he got whenever she told him anything that signaled her academic success. It was more than an expression, something like a youthful lightness that shone through his eyes and spread across his face. He would regard her not as a dad but as the twenty-one-year-old who had first come to America from Poland with dreams of a better life. He had come a long way from his tiny village and seeing that she was on track to go even further brought all of that old hope back to him.  But underneath her happiness was guilt. Marcus had given Ella the internship, not Irina. She felt as though she was living a life that wasnt meant to be within her reach. How long would she be able to keep this faade going? Ella wasnt supposed to go this far, to have a boyfriend and close friends. Their trust would be broken if they found out the truth. She wished she hadnt lied to them in the first place, especially to Marcus. Maybe they would have liked her anyway. But what if they hadnt? Where would she be without them? Using Ella had become so normal that not once had she thought to question her or think of what she would do when the people she met, who she thought would flit in and out of her life, ended up staying.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2022  Analog darkroom chemicals and retouch inks on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 40 in  Marcus felt far away. Flimsy and unstable, as though at any moment their hands would separate and hed float over the railing. He was drunk, telling her how he thought of them as two puzzle pieces. Im so lucky to have found someone whos ambitious and loves the same things as me. You know that dream I told you about? He was referring to owning his own engineering firm one day, having a huge office with leather-clad chairs, a vintage globe, windows overlooking the city, and a decanter of brandy, in which he would meet with clients and mentor interns. Ella said she remembered and that it was a very reachable goal. Im glad were both engineers because you can be in that picture with me. Thats the one thing it was missing. You. Would he still say that if he knew the truth? Or would his expression change from adoration to confusion and then to anger? Would he go inside and tell everyone what an awful person she was? A liar, a gold digger, an imposter. Theyd gasp and gawk at her through the glass. She couldnt bear to lose him. Maybe we can find a way to sneak into your dads office while were there and pretend its yours. That could be fun, Ella said.  You mean pretend its  .  Ours. She tried the word out on her tongue and rolled the short syllable, trying to make it last.   The next morning, Irina woke up before sunrise. Her head throbbed, and her stomach felt wrong. She should have eaten something before drinking last night. Irina curled up into a ball and tried to disappear into Marcuss bed, wanting to get a couple more hours of sleep before having to face the inevitable pain of her hangover. She scrunched her eyes shut and tried to focus on her breathing, but all she heard was Marcuss snoring. It seemed to match her heads pulsing discomfort, and the more energy she put into ignoring it, the more annoying it became. Fuck. She rolled the covers off and tiptoed out of his room.  In the bathroom, she turned on the tap to mask the sound of her throwing up. She vomited straight alcohol. It burned her throat and made her eyes water as she struggled to catch her breath against the heaving. Her skin was slick with sweat when she was done, and she rinsed it off before brushing her teeth. She cleaned her face, put on some concealer, blush, and a tinted lip balm, and brushed out her hair until she appeared well-rested and rosy-cheeked.  As awful as throwing up was, it was necessary to feel better. She left the bathroom no longer sweating or having stomach pains and wandered to the kitchen. She chugged a glass of water and started up Marcuss Nespresso while imagining what living there would be like. She saw herself sitting cross-legged on the sofa with her laptop, writing papers, sipping coffee, and resting her eyes on the view past the huge floor-to-ceiling windows that made up two of the four walls, now covered by curtains. Marcus would recline next to her, doing work or reading. She would paint her nails on the kitchen island as the television played an old 2000s movie. Shed fill the wall above the potted lemon tree with a vintage movie poster. Shed host girls nights where she, Diana, Sasha, and Kathleen would drink cocktails and do face masks. Shed sip wine and watch Marcus paint on Sunday nights, and maybe, after living here for a while, shed feel secure enough, close enough to being Ella, to let him paint her as he kept asking to do, without the fear that under such scrutiny, he would somehow piece together her falseness. The thought of a version of herself that could have every minuscule detail analyzed, be exposed and vulnerable, made Irina hopeful.  Living here, finishing her degree, having that internship, and going to grad school would allow Irina to merge with Ella. Shed have to pretend less and less until not at all. The smell of coffee warmed the room, working against the AC humming in the background of her thoughts. She walked to the curtains that covered the windowed walls and flung them apart.  The rising sun filled the room with a white and blue glow. It gleamed off the coffee table and was absorbed by the white couch, making it flush against the shadows of the kitchen.  Dietmar Busse,  , 2022  Analog darkroom chemicals and retouch inks on silver gelatin photographic paper, 42 x 40 in  Outside, the windows of similar apartments surrounded her. Some of them lit up warm yellow, signaling that she wasnt the only early riser. Irina pictured men and women, some of them hungover, waking up with a grunt and a jolt, children jumping on their beds, dogs sneaking off furniture before their owners awoke. Water gurgled down sinks, toilets flushed, toasters popped, and kettles whistled. The sun inched further into the sky, each minute working to replace the bleak blue with purple that would soon become pink.   Good morning, love. She hadnt heard Marcus come up behind her. He kissed Irinas cheek and hugged her. Without realizing it, he put pressure on her body, pushing her forwards and making her hold her hand out against the window to catch herself. He leaned into her, forcing her hand tighter against the chilled glass. Irina glanced down at the street. Shed seen this view hundreds of times before, but now, with her full weight pushing into her hand, she became aware of how high up she was. Uneasiness crept into her body. Wispy thoughts of the glass cracking gained momentum until they clamored within her. Irina felt dizzy as the window appeared to tilt forwards. She felt as though her life could break through the glass at any minute. She struggled to keep her balance and feared throwing up again.  Good morning, she said. More lights switched on outside and mingled with the pinkish golden glow of the sky. Marcus turned her around and engulfed her in another embrace. She sank into him, burying her face in his shirt that smelled of sleep and traces of cologne. Irina took a step back and brushed her cold hand against his warm, groggy face. I made coffee.

        "text": "Art by Samira Abbassy Samira Abbassy,  , 2021  Oil on birch panel, 48x36 inches When the people first stormed the streets, Minas brothers had cheered and clapped. The Shah is gone. Were rid of his evil ways. But then her mothers miniskirts were outlawed and now bearded men covered every corner of every street dressed in army fatigues holding guns. And all that was legal beforebare legs, alcohol, loving Americawas suddenly against the law. Kelloggs cornflakes were nearly impossible to find. Saddam had dropped the first bombthe first one in the middle of the night when shed been asleep. Bam. The house shook and down they all went to the basement. He had very good eyes, she knew that much. His planes could see mice at midnight under no moon. Why else would the entire population of her city cover their windowpanes with aluminum foil? He would kill her once he found her. That much she knew. The men in her country had almost all gone madgrowing beards, carrying around speeches of new Ayatollahs, holding in their hands knives and yelling, Death to the Shah! even though he was already dead from cancer, frozen with grief under the soil of a foreign country. But the biggest most frightening madman of all lived in the country next door. In Iraq he sat, drinking tea and holding conferences with advisors who wanted to kill her. They would all, she knew, kill her if they could. She darted to school and darted backno longer confident that his planes wouldnt dare try bombing in broad daylight. At night, as she said her prayers, she almost felt like the basement was a finer place to rest her head than her bed. For, surely, and this happened often, he dropped his bombs in the middle of the night, and there she and her parents and brothers would be, crowded, shivering, huddling as close as possible to the earth. If she could slide under the ground to escape the bombs, she would. She couldnt let him win. As she spread sour cherry jam on her   bread, she vowed he wouldnt get her or anyone else left in her family. She imagined him drawing on his chart with a huge black felt-tip pen, tracking her moves. Did he know she swam on Wednesdays at her cousins house? Probably.  Every night before bed she bargained with God. Keep my mother alive. I will not lie about anything ever again. Keep my father alive. I will stop procrastinating on my homework. My brothers. I promise I won't argue with them anymore. Keep us alive and dont, please dont, let Saddam win. And Godhe must be on her side.  She didnt call him Allah, just  , the Persian word for God. She prayed to a God that looked much like a picture of the ancient poet Rumi. She wagered that she would live and that he, Saddam, would die first. Samira Abbassy,  , 2022  Collage, acrylic, gouache on card, 15x11 inches One day she made a list of all the things she still had yet to do. Finish elementary school. Get my period. Learn to cook like my mother and grandmother. Master eighty-eight double-dutch jumps in a row, no pausing. Kiss a boy (one day). Help poor people all over. Memorize at least one hundred ghazals of Hafez. Learn to roller skate. Make lots of paintings. End all wars somehow. The list went on and on. Plenty. See that, Saddam?  She had plenty left to do. So for him to bomb her country and kill her just wasnt going to work out with her plans. But he was everywhere. She saw an outline of his mustache in the clouds. In the sheen of the oily water of the citys sewer  , she was sure she counted his fat fingers floating. Parts of the tufts of his hair appeared in her lentil rice. When her grandmother died in his bomb, Mina knew then for sure that Saddams goal was to stomp her spirit dead. As she cried at the funeral holding onto her mothers hand, she promisedeven as she looked above for his planesthat he wouldnt get her. He would not kill, he would not erase her from the world, he would not prevent her from accomplishing the important work laid out for her. Iran started to swell and then fold in on the sides, deflated finally to a bump of prickly sadness. She wanted to go to the post office to mail a letter to her uncle in America, but Saddam had bombed the place. She went to her other cousin Rezas house to play cards with him now that he was back from the war, but Saddam had blown his hands up. Men, her brothers friends, disappeared in small trucks, vowing to fight him to the end. Get him.  Samira Abbassy,  , 2019  Oil on birch panel, 30x24 inches It was practically 1982 and Saddam was still parading around. If she were to cup her hands around her mouth and shout out to the world to come help them, would anybody hear her? The world hated her country more than they hated his. Her brother said that the US and Britain sold arms to Saddam because they preferred him over them. Could she drag Ronald Reagan by the hand and convince him, the most powerful man in the world, to stop the war? Could she show President Reagan the chemical weapons Saddam used, could she convince him to not help Saddam so? Mr. Reagan wouldnt listen to her though. Hed probably slap her across the face and say, Girlie girl, your country took the hostages! Then shed have to walk across town to where the lunatic-fanatic students who held the American hostages stayed and try and have them change their minds. Her cousins friend smuggled an issue of a teen magazine from America. That was the most enticing possession she had to barterevery girl in school (except the brainwashed regime zealot Farnaz) envied her for having the magazine as they pored over its pages in the bathroom. But the students who held the hostages wouldnt want   magazine. What did they want? She wasnt sure. If Ronald Reagan couldnt help, then really it was hopeless because no one was more powerful than him. So strong. Clearly, he didnt mind that Saddam was killing them or that her government was killing the Iraqi people. He was busy, she knew. Plus, the hostages. That made everybody hate the whole country. Those damn fanatic students. To pack the right books for school, to memorize the history dates due that day, to learn Arabic words, to not get killed at daytime, or especially at nighttime, to find a way to get Mr. Reagan to hate Iran less than he hated Saddamshe had a lot to do. Which was precisely why she couldnt die. As her mother braided her hair, Mina counted the number of ways she could get him. A ten-year-old girl didnt have much access to equipment. Her options were limited. But hed already killed her grandmother and she couldnt let Saddam keep killing more. Could she get to his palace? The borders were closed. She couldnt escape the country, couldnt carry a weapon into his bedroom at two in the morning, look him in the eye, tell him he had killed her grandmother, the postman, blown off her cousins hands, murdered half her brothers friends, and turned the playground into rubble. Oh, but if only she could. Saddam would pause, beg her to reconsider. Mina would, at that point, beat his ugly face with both her fists, punch him hard, bash his head against the headboard of the bed, maybe even stomp on him till he begged for mercy. Afterwards, shed become a hero. The Iranian government would praise her and hold a huge ceremony. Theyd award her a medal for stopping Saddam. At the celebration she would give a speech where shed thank her mother for all her hard work and pay homage to the spirit of her grandmother. Mina would tell the whole country about the thick   soup her grandmother made, how Mamani loved Rumi and how shed spent time picking out new juicy pomegranates for Mina the day that she died. Which is why she died. Which was what was killing Mina. Then Mina would boldly announce that some girls hated being forced to cover their hair and bodies, that it wasnt right, and shed be brave enough to say out loud that the new laws were far too restrictive, and people shouldnt be put in jail just because they said something bad about the regime. Samira Abbassy, Transfiguration (Green), 2022  Oil on panel, 30x24 inches There would be silence. People would slowly nod, look at one another, then clap and soon the whole crowd would cheer and yell, Freedom! Freedom! Demokrahsee! The new Islamic hard-liners would hang their heads in shame and say they were sorry, they didnt know what was wrong with them, they had punished and imprisoned and executed so many people for no reason and if everyone would just give them a second chance, theyd like to try again and be a democracy this time. But the people would yell, Get the hell out of here, you lousy hypocrites! And the hard-liners would flee for their lives and move to Pakistan. A few suggestions would be made for a new leader. Minas name would be thrown around. People would trust her to lead in the tradition of the ancient child-emperors in China. A petition would be drawn to have her elected. But Mina would politely refuse, say no, she was busy with school and the obligations of fifth grade, and finally, reluctantly, the people would let her go. They would get to work setting up plans for a new election and the beginning of democracy. And that day the country would be free. Everyone would dance in the streets till two in the morning, just like after winning a soccer game, only more, and the women would throw their headscarves triumphantly up in the air, not even caring anymore that their hair showed. Her mother and father would do a jig in the middle of the town square. Food trucks would pass out celebratory cotton candy and popcorn and small round colorful chocolates, the exact kind Bita had served at her tenth birthday party. Mina would be given a tiara to wear like the one her Barbie doll had when Barbie dolls were still allowed in the country. Barbie dolls would be allowed again. Minas parents would buy her a new red bicycle which she would ride to school as her hair blew freely in the wind and no men with guns guarded the street corners at all. At recess they would play dodgeball and gossip again, instead of singing war songs and death chants. Girls and boys wouldnt have to go to separate schools anymore. Thered be no more bombs at night at all because Saddam would be gone. And everyone could start off 1982 with hope that there really could be peace in the world.

        "author": "Bayo Ojikutu",
        "text": "Art by Diedrick Brackens Diedrick Brackens, , 2019.  Woven cotton and acrylic yarn, 72 x 72 inches Five years into Old Maggies transformation of the England of their arrival, Samuels father took a nine-month trip to unknown parts of the world. Oluwasegun Ayodeji departed wife and children and never explained his journey to them in explicit fashion. If their mother, Funmilayo, knew details of his departure, shed remained dutifully morose in her silence.   Segun returned to their home in Peckham, London just before the Christmas season of Samuels tenth year. He took his children aside and told them there were two places on earth that reminded him of the Nigeria of their origin. It was important for them to know of these places, he insisted, and not of where hed been nor what hed done for much of the Year of Their Lord 1991. Critical, despite the fact that none except the parents knew anything substantive of the homeland to which he compared the outposts.   According to the father, there was a territory known as Balochistan in the Indus River Valley, a place Oluwasegun called the south-central-middle of the world.  The part of Balochistan of which he spoke stretched for kilometers. Parched and patchy grasslands, lush growth sprouting erratically from soil that sliced at the soles of those shepherd clans who tended the province. Balochistan reminded their father of Nigerias Middle Belt, the area of tribal contest drawn between his countrys commercial Southwest, the Delta East, and the militarized North. That Belt served as the true Nigerian bush, the region from which the Ayodeji clan had hailed generations prior.   The other familiar global province in the eyes of the Yoruba taxi driver was the Black American Ghetto. Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, North Philly, Roxbury, Columbia Heights in the countrys capital, the Cape in Middlesbrough. Those places to one extent or another reminded their baba of Lagos, still the capital of Nigeria thenthe ghetto recalled specifically the Surelere community from which their mothers family hailed, he said.  Stay away, Segun advised with a bass gravity that his children had not heard for so long, its insistence given by the heavy accent of Yorubaland. Samuel remembered nodding to relieve the stress in the senior Ayodejis sound. But the boy was not certain what his father meant to dissuade. Were he and his siblings to avoid the regions hed mapped in recollection, their mothers madcap family back in Surelere, or were they to stay away from those Pashtun shepherds and ghettoized Americans who had so recalled Oluwaseguns countrymen?        Samuel did not know whether his father had actually visited the Middlesbrough Cape during his travels either. But the boy had listened, and hed believed in the man. When he traveled through the countrys major urban centers as an adult, he avoided the places found in the far corners of each of its Dream metropolises. He had also been to Lagos as an adult many times, and he had seen the Nollywood movies and their Tinseltown source work. Telling tales of black wires and hoods menacing society. From what the son encountered, what hed been shown on either side of the Pond, Baba Segun had spoken truth, regardless how the taxi-man had come about his privy. Diedrick Brackens, , 2020.  Woven cotton and acrylic yarn, 96 x 96 inches Given what sprawled through those commuter bus windows, Samuel did not take well to Maurishka the Teaching Assistants invitation to meet her that first Monday of August. She had led a group of minority undergraduates to a library in the middle of the Capestudying a destination far outside of their campus gates, a neighborhood the Middlesbrough newscasters referred to as  .   Maurishka Alaiyo was not of the place herself. She hailed from a suburb to the east. Yet the graduate student proclaimed the depth of her inundation in this boroughs culture, extolling its art and its funky blues music, while working on multicultural studies or ethnic literature or some such thesis credit in an obligatory elective. As she explained it, that five-mile stretch of the city was impoverished not by chance nor by divinity, and not by the design of a clan of overlords. All those tales were fantastic ruses told both by Cape residents spilling over with despondency, and by those who held some contempt for an indigent lot.  But the place did suffer in a chronic way. Peopled by the grandchildren of exiles who came to Middlesbrough with nothing in hand of hard value. No gemstones, no currency, no crops, no deeds to bound land. Nothing in their effects to barter except that which would be taken from them without recourse: labor, talent, the will to genuflect at the leisure of those who ate high on the swine come feast time. That was the Middlesbroughs story, not only out there on its Cape dangling in toxic Midlands Bay water, but on the mainland, throughout the city, far beyond.   To ensure that he could cover his lodging and afford to eat while his contract employer arranged his pay, Samuel determined that he would ride cabs and the drone-operated Kruse service only on weekends. Otherwise, hed use the public transit.   His city bus commute lurched five miles from the Capes riverfront entry, through hills full of dilapidated flats squeezed stonewall-to-stonewall along narrowly-rising rows and parkways reflecting beige in the scalding sun. Middlesbroughs subterranean rail would have taken him to his destination quicker, by ten or fifteen minutes during the afternoon commute hours. But the   had printed so many stories about the Underground lair and its shadowy turn beneath  . Surely Samuel did not believe all of the reporting, no more than he could fathom his father actually visiting such a place in 1991. But hed heard just enough, and he needed to make it safely to payday. The aboveground streets dimmed as the eco-secure carrier wound about Midlands Bay. Maurishka often waxed effusively of the evangelized churches there along 115th Street, the jazz sets that once were heard at the Bay End nightclubs, home-cooked Southland food and ad hoc hairstylists thriving long before, along Old Gabriel Road. Divas and shiny silk suits   along the Lowlands strip before dipping into ramshackle caves in The Bog near the Capes heart.  Listening to her celebrate what his father cautioned as a slum, he was convinced that the graduate student referred to the place as it appeared in some mid-twentieth-century black-and-white picture book. The kind that celebrated the Glory Bound wonders of magic hot combs, custard pies, collard greens, and electrified blues guitar.  Either that, or she had only spoken of the place as shed imagined it through the tan fancy in her own suburban, dew-filled eyes. As he looked through the transit windows, Samuel asked himself: Who faced what was and spoke its truth, and who clutched onto some make-believe and testified thereto? Was it his father Oluwasegun Ayodeji, the Middlesbroughs   newspaper, or the comparative literature/cultural studies teaching assistant, Maurishka Alaiyo McClean? The transit bus dipped into the Cape valley, and Samuel caught one final view of the Sanguinis River spilling into Midlands Bay, meeting there, through the opened rear window, opposite his destination. Disappearing waters and a sliver of the City Center towers backdropped the aisle in which he stood for those eight miles.  He pressed the summons for the next stop as the bus approached the Sojourner Truth Library depot. Diedrick Brackens, , 2020.  Woven cotton and acrylic yarn and sewing notions, 82 x 79 inches As he crossed Old Gabriel Road, Samuel eyed a pedestrian encroaching upon his path.  The interloper wore a desert-beige military fatigue jacket unbuttoned at the stomach as they passed the library exterior. It was the heavy jacket that had caught his attention given the muggy air. As that pedestrian moved through the middle-mans path, Samuel sensed a familiarity in his gait. He was not certain and the younger man paid him no apparent attention before disappearing behind street construction posts, but the elaborate stride reminded him of that student who had introduced himself as Joshua Nebbie in front of Maurishkas apartment compound. Samuel found Maurishka on the librarys second floor, instructing her Midlands charges before sparse bookshelves. He approached only after shed dismissed them for the morning.     I have never seen you in gym shoes before. She studied his health-club wear, and the jagged gray at the edge of his hairline; Alaiyo had never seen him without recent grooming either. When in Babel he said. We hadnt talked since that night. Thank you for coming. It is a long way to this place. I said I would meet you where you are. In your area of study.  She sat at a long library table, crossing her legs. He felt himself looming over Alaiyo, but he did not take a seat just yet. You are angry? No, he said. Not at all. What about? Josh. Who? She did not reply. Oh, the boythat was his name? You know, I think I might have seen him outside just now. Could have been him. Is he one of your students here? I'm sorry about all of that, Samuel. Her hand reached across the table wood for nothing in particular. Samuel sat. I had a really fine time at the party you took me to. Terrible way to end a date. You cant control the miscreant clowns showing up on your doorsteps, can you? This is a free country, like they say. It was a Saturday night, wasnt it? What does your music say about fever? Fever and freaks, yes. He was my boyfriend. Im helping him with a major essay. So he   your student then. No, she repeated, in a manner of speaking. Im trying to help keep him in the university. Samuel felt his lips twisting. I see. He seemed like a nice fellow, the boy. Hes one of the many youve known? I didnt say that I knew many boys. It was you who said that. Maurishka heard her volume rising in the back of her throat and relaxed against the library chair. I did, in jest, you are right. Diedrick Brackens, , 2018.  Woven cotton and acrylic yarn, 72 x 72 inches She opened the eight-hundred-page   which shed carted along for discussion. Her gaze squinted over the table of contents with which she was well familiar. Why are you still here? I came to see you. You asked me. She frowned. Why are you still in Middlesbrough? When you left that night, I thought I wasnt going to see you for months. Theres this thing I am working on, with a man. The judge who hosted the cookout. Im working on something with him on Merchants Row. Wrapping up another thing, but just getting started with this new business thing. Men and business things. She paged to the middle of her dense text, but read none of the words. Do you have a place to stay? City Center. He rubbed the top of his head, smoothing the mat of tight curls against his scalp. The Crown-Ritz on 5th. Thank you for the invitation to visit you. Maurishkas gaze reminded him of Lizzie Maddens cutting at his jugular in a computer laboratory across town. It is corporate, he said. Do you know why I had my mail routed to your place? We havent talked about that. Things weren't going well with the first thing With the first business thing or the first man? I knew that I would end up here in town longer than I intended, the way the thing was goingwasnt going. So I gave the Ritz your address, just in case. The explanation rang true to Samuels ear, although it had just come to him in the moment. I apologize for the presumptuousness, Alaiyo. I guess you would say that we shouldve talked about it. No, I actually said you have nothing to apologize to me for. Now, your failure to ask me to the Crown-Ritz, thats some ritzy shit. She laughed at herself and looked around the librarys study space, scanning for lingering students.  I thought I might ask you whether I could stay at your place as this thing runs over. But I dont want to make your ex-boy in the parachute pants angry. Diedrick Brackens, , 2022.  Woven cotton and acrylic yarn, 84 x 79 inches Maurishka did not blink. He wondered whether there was some medicationa specially-engineered eye dropthat American women used to keep their irises moist while fixed in such glares. So the thing with this Judge Gold, what is the problem? He gasped and choked at once, but he had no choice other than to respond. Its a big new energy deal. Some people need the judges help. Regulatory case, your federal government and all of its filings. Gets sticky because the judge is looking to diversify into oil futures No pun intended, the graduate student chuckled at herself again. while hearing the case. Crude barrels. Theyre cheap now. Hedge money. Give it three, four years, 2028? Another election year? An entirely virtual market. You should keep track of these things, too. But there is conflict, always conflict between competing interests.  Its the way of these deals. What is your angle? He sensed her legs uncrossing. Im just trying to help. Could be a terrific opportunity for the judge and his wife. I just want to be there as they seek the proper investment strategy. The Honor phone buzzed in his jogging pants pocket, that particular sequence hed assigned to Naida Begzadi. His wife is Nigerian, but I dont think they trust me. I just want to do my job. If I cant do it now, on this affair, I may not be able to do it in this country again. One of those students just used a word after we exited the subway station. Describing the Haitians leaving Port-au-Prince back in the 90s. He was trying to impress me, I suppose.  Something about the rail reminded him of this term. It is one of my favorites in the language, I dont know why.   was what he said. Yes, I saw a European movie by that name, some years back. Italian, maybe? Maurishka closed the postcolonial text. Means men, things, interests, ritzy shit.  How do you put it? Its the way these days? Diedrick Brackens, , 2018.  Woven cotton and acrylic yarn, 79 x 72 inches An old man dragged himself toward the library, attempting to enter through the exit way. Samuel held the door for Maurishka first, then for the haggard fellow. Despite his apparent confusion, Samuel did not attempt to redirect the man. His clothing appeared ripped and splattered in blotches along collars and seams. His skin was the tint of jaundice, and his air reeked of rotgut liquor.  He looked into Samuels face and the middleman forced a smile. The elder did not return the gesture. You think theyll let me use the facilities today? he asked instead. The library is public, isnt it? Samuel looked at Maurishka, who had paused near the street curb, holding the postcolonial text in both arms. Everyone uses the facility, as I understand it. Thats what its for. The old man searched Samuels face without entering the building. Something like familiarity flashed in the dim slits above an irritated nose. The toilet? Is the facilities open, nigga? The old man made a noise of pained exhaust before seeking out the restroom on his own.   Samuel and Maurishka Alaiyo walked on along Old Gabriel Road, toward the Underground railway. She had convinced the foreigner to ride to the City Center so that perhaps he could have a look at what her student meant by his use of that word, imbroglio, and so that she could visit his unpaid-for Crown-Ritz Hotel lodging on the metropolitan mainland.

Going somewhere, to his house, which may not be his house.    Bali goes west of Indian Ocean, not Mozambique, in fact, he goes further west of Cabo Delgado where there is a song which goes like   Dont we, he goes not to Tanzania where Swahili whispers are squirming in the velvet sky, but rather south of Kyela where his blooming silhouette cuts into the circumference of the virgin morning breeze.  Bali crisply craws into the bewitching expanse of Malawian flora via Songwe Border where brow-furrowed immigration officers leave their arms at V and gesture for him to   stop and ask him headless questions about his border pass which he doesnt bother to produceand many dont produce because  and about his passport which he doesnt haveand many dont even have an idea what the thing is.  Bali cringes his head at a lopsided angle and the hungry temples of the men in uniform flush on a wad of his gleaming shillings and kwachas and their otherwise noble duty, which delicately spins around a whiff of lust, propels his bushed limbs to scurry, as the officers mumble their provocative Swahili Furahiya kukimbia kwako and their fascinating Chichewa Muyende bwino. Bali submits the sticking weight of his luscious buttocks to a fully-packed yellow minibus as the disconcerting aroma of   fish from Songwe River ricochets through open spaces and he finds a suffocating purchase at the back seat where the horrifying stench that mobs his busy nose is that of a rotten egg mixed with that of a dead fish; and at once, he realizes that the thing here is: business and bathing are like water and oil, men keep their mortal stink in their armpits, women keep their lethal odor in their undiesand thats okay as long as we have our merchandise and we have customers home, they say and if you want to know, they purchase their clothes and their wrappers in Kyela District of Tanzania and they sell their merchandise at more than double the purchase price and their market is their home and home is Malawi where people crash bubbles of ice into the embers of petrol fire until their mighty deity listens, where wiry women climb to peaks of mountains because God is there and God will give them their husbands, where electric power will locate your house after years of asking but dont be too excited because blackouts, too, will come.  A few years ago, Yasini Baligani Pombe, or Bali for his liking, bought bricks and cement and timber and iron sheet; and a house was almost built, almost because there was no more money, almost because the house was not complete and then, there was xenophobia because Malawians were saying Tanzanians had to go and Bali did not want to die, he had to flee. Now Bali is going to see his house, a house which may not be his house. Artschoolscammer,  , 2021  Mixed media and acrylic, 42 x 42 inches Bali is at Karonga Boma where summer leaves slap the comforts of the burgeoning boulevards and then, he walks along Chitipa-Karonga Road going northwards like he is going to Chitipa where joyous women love with the sleeves of their cheeks when the thing between your legs promises fireworks of Christmas. He walks some more and sees a glaring billboard announcing WELCOME TO CHANKHALAMU DIOCESE where people come to make confessions that later become touch me like that, brother. Bali walks a little more and turns to his left so that his eyes lock with the mind-boggling spectacle of the diocese whose perimeter is as striking as are tousled wrinkles of Bishop Sylvester Mwafulirwa who triumphantly stands on its pulpit.  He pushes his way to late Tata Mungetemwesa Gondwes mahogany-painted shop which has a somewhat derogatory and boisterous KyaNgonde inscription FYANGU FYO FYANGU, literally translating to MINE IS MINE, and he greets late Mr. Gondwes widowfondly known in these spaces as Bungathe chubby yet self-deprecating woman in the shop who asks him with a face of someone that has loathed him forever, What do you want? instead of asking him, How can I help you, customer? Bali tells her he is going somewhere, he does not say he is going to his house and Bunga makes a stinging slur sound that can dismantle her husbands grave and Bali drinks in her seductive rebuke even if he wishes he could chop the stout neck off her pumpkin-like head but he eschews the bubbles of a potential misogynic storm that may ensue.  He turns around late Gondwes rectangular shop as if he is heading to Bwiba Catholic Institute, the one that was constructed with a fat check that flew all the way from old cardinals that form a retinue in Nairobi, and he treads, ever so carefully, on a sandy road with his long tongue wagging like he is Mama Veros dog that eats once a month, and then he is swallowed by the breathtaking green of Mwanganda woodlands where a threesome of crickets chime in for a familiar childhood chorus. As he puts each cautious step forward, he fights against the impossible aura of meeting a lion that can divide him into two or three or meeting a cobra that can shoot a drip of poison into his blistering groin.  Bali then plods in the face of a tombstone engraved MRS. DINNAH MWAMPAGHATWA, BORN 21/08/1959, DIED 17/03/2013, BURIED 19/03/2013, REST IN PEACE.    Yasini Baligani Pombe, or Bali for his liking, is still going because he has not seen his house but knows he will see it soon.  Bali passes an isolated, concrete borehole that dings on the cunning lips of Honorable Anganile Mwamondwe who, with his blue tie swinging in the hot of air, always said, Vote for me again, I will bring more developments.   Bali then sees Mwesha Hill, that gloomy Old Apostolic Church where a boy complains of headache that swirls through nerves in his head and his mother says, God will find you and everyone applauds the audacity of her faith and the boy makes a face that tells the mother to listen carefully and the mother listens and then does not listen and the boy touches his stomach as his bowels sing a national anthem but the mother, still ingrained in her shrewd benevolence, prays, God, heal my son before the boys breath cascades, and then hushes up and the mother shouts My son, can you hear me? and the boy does not answer.  Bali then crosses Mwesha River, ever so diligently, clothes rolled to his knees, cardigans blowing in the untidy winds and shoes (are they, really?) suspended in his hands and the venom of angry tides fang his cold toes as if to stop him from thrusting forward.  Yasini Baligani Pombe, or Bali for his liking, is still going because he misses his house which may not be his house.  Bali saunters through Chamavi Bush which stinks like the behind of Tata Wangu Inn where people export and import all quantities of HIV and his brothers Syphilis and Gonorrhea and Candidiasis.  He then strolls a little more and sees a ragged hut that keeps an old woman whose husband died although she did not know until after a week because she was too drunk.  Bali then walks for a few seconds until his eyes settle on a brick bungalow that looks deserted and is not finished: windows filled with sacks, roof covered partly with corrugated iron, partly with a grass thatch, a big house, maybe five huge bedrooms and a giant living room and a gigantic dining room, but not completed yetand alone: four of the neighboring houses in sight are each almost ten minutes away.  Yasini Baligani Pombe, or Bali for his liking, has seen his houseand the bungalow is his house, but Bali is not relieved.  He glides towards the veranda of the bungalow whose rough floor has patches of concrete and he throws his right fist at the wooden door with a bang of someone that whips the leather of a Mapenenga drum and then he knocks again, hoping to awaken someone or something from a start; after some edgy minutes pass, a fairly young man opens the door, only a crack, then opens it fully ajar because there is no use hiding and the man stands at the doorjamb with foundered eyes, with a mixture of deep shock and introspection and Bali learns that not too far from here, there is a house that hosts ego-driven royalty and that village headman is Mwanganda who has gone to America and speaks English through his hollow nostrils, but Bali doesnt care about who is blessed and who is not blessed because his eyes are on the man at the door, who himself is choked with emotions and is full of questions, yet apparently empty of answers.  Yasini Baligani Pombe, or Bali for his liking, is not a man to fight but he does not know the man at the door and his house was supposed to be vacant.  Bali is looking at the man at the door, who the man thinks he is and who the man is, really.  Artschoolscammer,  , 2022  Mixed media collage, size variable If you want to know the man at the door, the man, maybe thirty, who likes to skulk to his neighbors transparent curtains and watches a war on TV and Ukrainians are asking his people, Help us and his people are saying, How can we help you? and his people are also saying, How can we be thinking about what to eat and then, we are also thinking about  and his people are laughing in the way you will mock a man that borrowed your money and comes back to borrow more money.   If you want to know the man at the door, the man that likes to take his screen-tainted Samsung smart phone and opens Google and types the word   and watches young women undress and display their delicious breasts and their wet creases that vibrate with vicious powers and there are men, some with a skin that looks like misty coal tar, some with muscles that look more artificial than superficial they are, and the men, with pure softness and tenderness, clamber onto the resigned bodies of the naked women and the rest, as they say, is history.  If you want to know the man at the door, the man that likes to reduce his trunk to a sleeping position like a whore that has sold her real life to wonder and then he unzips and tells the thing that is long and monstrous to see the naked bodies on his phone and then, the thing, such a thirsty thing, obliges and bulges to a strain of pressure, he takes the thing, such a morbid thing, into his clenches and then, calls for friction to explode and lets white, creamy fluids out and glances as his frail heartbeat vaporizes on the walls and he smiles a smile that is satisfying and complete, feeling like one lucky bug, and he weaves his forlorn soul outside and sits under the antique mango tree and grabs all the pull of cool winds that blush his eyelashes.  If you want to know the man at the door, the man that loves to call his girlthere is a girlfriend by the wayand tell her I love you and she says I love you too, and the couple, like all lovebirds, thrives, laughs, and he tells her, Will you come tomorrow, I am horny and she says Tomorrow, thats fine and the girl sometimes comes, sometimes does not come until she says, I have something that has been troubling me and she says, I am not saying its over, and then she says, I hope you will find someone that loves you.  If you want to know the man at the door, the man that has gone to school and has got a bachelors degree in social economics from University of Malawi, the Polytechnic, but has no job five years after graduation and has nothing really and has stayed with aunts and uncles and cousins and friends who have had a lot to crow about because they said, We too have other people that look up to us and one cold morning, the man at the door was looking at himself in a mirror and at once, he saw an image of someone else, someone in solitude, someone left to do all by himself, someone left to figure it out and then, in the end, after thinking this and dismissing that and after measuring this and ignoring that and after asking this and answering that, he discovered that he was someone that had nowhere to go.  If you want to know the man at the door, the man who hired a bicycle taxi which helped him through Karonga-Chitipa Road, the cyclist pedaling with a hell of rush such that the man at the door had never experienced and the taxi dropped him at the Roundabout and then, he had to negotiate with the chaos of congested housing behind Nitikesyosa Maizemill and he asked, Where does Prophet Mfwilaseko Simeza stay? and they said, You are still, keep going and he walked through muddy views and smelling toilets and glossy Airtel and TNM towers and ubiquitous Premier Bet vessels and he asked again, Where is the Prophets house? and they said, You are not there yet but you will be there, and he walked through gatherings of funerals and meetings of village peasants and sermons of church elders and he asked again, Do you know Prophet Simezas house? and they said, Do you see that house that is blue? Not that house. You will pass that one and then you will find a church and you will turn right and the house you see that is beautiful, it is his house. There is a brick fence and there is a black gate, and Prophet Mfwilaseko Simeza, quite unassuming unlike in the popular culture, gazed at the mans stolid face from the corner of his red eyes and he shook the monster of his head with a sense of panic that could even dislodge ESCOM poles that were behind his house, and then he took a haste stock of the mans features, from the top of his head down to his knees, and the prophet asked the man who he was and the man realized that said Prophet Simeza did not know him but he did not say, As a prophet, you must know me in your visionand why I am here and then, after Prophet Mfwilaseko Simeza asked the man other questions like Do you have faith? and after he prayed for him, the prophet said, You can think I have a big house, you can think I live alone. He exhaled before he continued, Do you know who I live with? Angels have bedrooms. I could accommodate you but the house is full. Just pray hard, my brother and the man was definitely amused but also displeased.    If you want to know the man at the door, the man in a self-destruct mode that has played with the idea of suicide because he believed it could feel mellow as if it were pellets of ice cream that you swallow for the first time in your life and then, sometimes, the man has dismissed the thought of suicide because he said, It doesnt make sense to die when all you can do is live, and then he has tried to think, What if I attempted? and then, he has tried to think, What if I dont?  If you want to know the man at the door, the man who walked and still walked because he had hope which was not too much but still was hope and that night, he had nowhere to sleep and he asked the first man, Can I sleep in your house just for tonight? and the first man, easy on the eye, said, Go to your uncles and the second man, his face brighter than a shooting star, said, Your aunts should answer and the third man, with a surreal humor, said, My house has no spare room and the fourth man, with a sonorous voice, said, I wish I could help but something is telling me no and the man walked and still walked with hope that was not too much but still was hope and there was a house, not complete but he decided it was habitable; and in morning and the morning after and the morning after, after he had uprooted the tallest of weeds and after he had swept the debris on the floor and after he had smoothened mounds, no one said, Leave my house and the house was, in his words, fine, no piercing noise at night, no billowing stare of an owl, nothing; and then, after a week and a week after and a week after, after he had put sacks in the windows and after he had put a latch on the front door and after he had fixed grass thatch in the master bedroom, no one said, Please leave this house, it is mine and the house, in his words, was okay, no ghosts in the corridors, no tempers of marauding birds, nothing; and then, after a month and a month after and a month after and a month after, after the house was not looking perfect but looking like someones house and after the house still had this smell but lets be honest, there was a considerable difference, after gossiping women said their words that were not compliments but the words inspired him to transform the house even more, the feeling of making this house his own must have started to bloom and must have sparkled infinitesimal pebbles of this is possible and must have ignited curious molecules of do it now and then, slowly like the slit of a tortoise, he took to the plain sky and looped his mind into a net and he discovered that the feeling of being called an owner was a tempting offer and fittingly so, and then, he made-believe himself that the house was his or was going to be his and then, in that way, it occurred to himeven if it could be he was apparently sitting on a ticking bomb identical to the Fat Man of Hiroshima and Nagasakithat the house was his own; and when he was sure the house was his, he shouted and shouted again and shouted again, even louder, and his voice echoed in the morning air and he declared, This is my house, and then he laughed, no signs of schizophrenia, no signs of a mind gone bad and he was even reading about   and even about  , not far-fetched an idea but isnt that being too ambitious? Far from the point, he said, The issue is this is my house, full stop.  And the issue that this house was, indeed, his house must have been rehearsed, must have been molten on a crucible, must have been frozen in an ice chamber, must have been cooled in open air, must have settled for all to see. And then, the man at the door happened to have a houseand the bungalow you see right now in front of your eyes, incomplete but splendid in his words, is his. Artschoolscammer,  , 2021  Mixed media and acrylic, 60 x 60 inches Look at the man at the door carefully.  One, he is Byronically handsome to some, especially to girls that let him come into them.  Two, he is dark like burnt shell of Napolo snake that invited incessant rains, destroying Phalombe villages in 1991. Three, he is tall like a blue gum tree in Mwanjabala Village, which when it was being cut didnt feel the momentum of the axe because old men of the village said, It is the only tree that has seen heaven.  Four, he has a witty pace that makes people gossip, Where is he rushing to? and Wont he fall? Five, he has a voice that does not start World War III; it only sticks to nerves in a way that blue seal lotion will clatter the freedom of your skin. Six, he might be a Christian.  How much ounce of banality must a head gain to turn Christian? And maybe, half of him is that Christian man, maybe half of him not much and he knows all those God things, he knows of a man that said, Let there be light and there was light, he knows of a man who commanded a sea to divide into two so that Gods people passed through, he knows of a man who used a bulls horn to murder other people and heaven clapped hands, he knows of a man who multiplied two slices of bread into thousands and there was no stock margarine, he knows little about women except that one was a prostitute and she confessed her sins to her master and there was love between them.  Artschoolscammer,  , 2022  Digital collage, size variable In reality, the man at the door was a Christian at first and he said good things about otherwise confusing creation theories and people at his church said, In you, there is the Holy Spirit, then he started to ask questions and other questions and more questions, questions that were not too Christian, questions like Jesus was born in Jerusalem, why was he not born in my Mwanganda Village? People at his church said, Chase the devil, causing him to ask more stupid questions and other stupid questions and some more stupid questions, questions like Joseph did not sleep with Mary and their son was born, who was the real father? and questions like My mother died at twenty and I am thirty, who will be older upon resurrection? People at his church said, Blasphemy. Now he doesnt ask questions and since he has discovered a whirlwind of illusions lacking certainty. And Tumpale is the man at the door. His citizenship identification card, which dangles from the base of his neck, says his sex is   and his date of birth is   (but the identification card does not talk about his twin sister, who said Tumpales mother was born in the morning and was dead in the afternoon). The identification card, which is now six months old, also says his full name is  , each name derived from KyaNgonde whose defiant diction is as radical as the pensive persona that preaches its essence. In 2004 when Tumpale was a boy, maybe thirteen with glimpses of first love, and he was in standard six and his graceful mother was someone he called his best friend, his mothers bony frame propped on one elbow and then, she placed her hands on her bosom and she said, Something is moving in my stomach like a snake and it is moving fast, and then the slim nurse, pumping her bloodied fists, said, What can I say that I have not said? and then his mother was a dead mother just like that. By this time, Tumpales deadbeat father, whose appalling face Tumpale could not recollect, had taught his mother how to thrive on the fringes of his lies and had already said words that were biting and were final and were especially enough: he said, I am coming but he never came backand has not come back.  Yasini Baligani Pombe, or Bali for his liking, is still looking at Tumpale right now and Bali reckons that Tumpale is not just the man at the door, he is also the one that is staring at Bali as though he intends to find a sharp knife which he will use to stab Balis abdomen and eject his intestines to be sure if his blood, too, has hemoglobinand the way Tumpales stare is steadfast and assuring, there is no doubt what can make him happier. Please, go away, Tumpale does not tell Bali but in case Bali still has no clue, his presence is as unwelcome as can it ever be repulsive.  Tumpale thinks Bali could be anything; could be someone who is looking for a job, any job, even slashing bush; could be a thief who is desperate to steal anything, even a shirt hanging on the line; could be an assassin looking for a man to sacrifice in exchange of millions; could be a police officer investigating something sinister. Maybe this house, maybe Tumpale.  And Tumpale also thinks Bali could even be the original owner of this house.   Impossible? Tumpale does not want this to be true, which explains his disgust, explains everything. He doesnt want Bali to be the owner, not because he will have nowhere else to go, not because Malawi Police Service will charge him for displaying conduct likely to cause breach of peace, but because this is his househe has dressed it and he has fed it, he announced his intention to own the house and he announced his ownership and he announced his happiness to own and no one came to ask him questions. He owns a house and this is his house and this is his house.  Case closed, may the court rise.  Tumpale looks at Bali again, still saying nothing, and then he looks at him once more with a cheeky frown before looking away. This time, he will look away forever.

        "title": "Three Amulet Stories  Evergreen Review",
        "author": "Roberta Allen",
        "text": "Art by Jojo Chansiri Jojo Chansiri,  , 2023 Artem preferred to think that the amulet he had stolen from the Wise Woman of Isan was only   since he planned on returning it, though he was not exactly sure when. With the help of the witchs hair amulet in his pocket, he wasnt sure how, but he was certain that with a little luck he could make the islanders like him. It was easy to understand why they avoided him. He never offered to help when he was needed, never pitched innot even to carry an injured islander to the healers shack. On this day, while everyone else was still clearing debris from the violent hurricane a week earlier that had devastated the island, sending trees flying, destroying dwellings, smashing cars, killing and injuring islanders, Artem was out walking along the beach.  He was not sure why but he walked several miles further than usual. Finally, up ahead, he saw something unfamiliar on the shore. Only when he was up close did he realize he was looking at a large battered suitcase that had probably fallen off a ship during the hurricane. He pried open the lock. When he looked inside he thought he was dreaming. Inside were gemstones! More gemstones than he could ever have imagined. Laughing, he thrust his hands into the suitcase, letting the precious stones wash over them. Amethysts, sapphires, opals, turquoise, jade, pearls, emeralds, amber, topaz, rubies, and other gems he could not name. Artem was sure that thanks to the amulet the islanders would at the very least begin to like him for sharing his precious find. Filling his pouch with as many gemstones as he could, he ran faster than he ever thought possible back to the village. In the village square, excited, he shouted to everyone about the gemstones and emptied his pouch on the hardpacked earth. The others stopped their cleanup and although they were skeptical, came over to look. We couldve used an extra pair of hands, one of the men said, hoping to make him feel guilty. But Artem was too engrossed in the precious stones to hear him. Only when the islander who knew about gemstones confirmed that they were real did the others begin to think that maybe Artem was not so bad after all.  Following him, a crowd ran towards the shore to find the suitcase and take it back to the village. After walking for some time, a few who could not keep up with the others stayed behind. At last Artem stopped and looked around. He was almost sure the suitcase had been in that spot. Maybe its further on, he said. Breathing hard in the dry heat, they continued along the shore, but Artem shook his head and said he had not walked as far as the Dragon Blood Tree which he remembered seeing in the distance. Is this some kind of joke? one of the angry islanders asked. Artem was understandably flustered.  Turning to face them, he said, It was here! I swear it was here!  The others said, We should have known!  Shamefaced, Artem headed back to the village with the crowd, trying not to hear their angry voices. We walked this far for nothing! one of the islanders said. All for nothing! the others chimed in. The angriest among them called him names. Upon their arrival, the Wise Woman of Isan who had been waiting in the village square showed Artem the amulet he thought he had carried with him. That cant be it, he said to her, thrusting his hand in his pocket. It was empty. As empty as the shore had been. Where is the suitcase? he asked. What suitcase? she replied. Even the gemstones he had left in the village square were gone. Jojo Chansiri,  , 2023 The ruler on the island of Selabi was short, though he considered himself tall and trim, even handsome, which made his followers laugh behind his back. The ruler also considered himself whimsical. One of his favorite  as he called themhad been to spread the rumor throughout the island that   had poisoned the drinking water. Of course, the ruler did not spread the rumor himself. That was done by his followers. Were there solvents in the water? Pesticides? Bacteria? Viruses? Arsenic? the islanders asked. In truth, the drinking water was fine, which they found out after it was tested by an expert.  Clearly, the rulers whims were not whimsical.  His followers, lacking the ability to think for themselves and afraid to disobey, did whatever he wanted. The ruler was particularly irked by the dissidents and entrusted his followers with the task of throwing them to their deaths from the highest cliff. But no matter how many dissidents were disposed of in this manner, their numbers continued to grow. Every day the ruler lost a few followers who had finally summoned the courage to join the ranks of the dissidents. To the ruler, everyone looked alike so he was unable to identify the renegades and punish them.  At last, fearing for his life, the ruler asked his daughter, the High Priestess, for an amulet to protect him. She was not eager to help. You wouldnt need an amulet, she said, if you treated the islanders with respect. But she knew her father would not listen. Reluctantlybecause he was her fathershe gave him a small oblong amulet which looked like a common gray stone. Jojo Chansiri,  , 2023 The husband of the High Priestess was furious when she told him but he kept his rage to himself. Unbeknownst to the ruler and his daughter, her husband was a leading dissident who had powers of his own that could equal and even surpass the powers of the High Priestess if his rage was great enough. On Selabi, it was customary for the couple to live in a smaller but stately residence on the grounds of the large, ornate, and tasteless palace of the ruler who surrounded himself with as many accoutrements of wealth as he could get his hands on. One night the husband stole into the rulers palace and made his way into the 24-karat-gold and marble bedroom. Feeling invincible, the ruler had nonchalantly left the amulet on his dresser before going to bed. As soon as the husband saw it, he knew that his rage would make jinxing his wifes amulet easy. He had only to spit on it, releasing a poison of his own, and utter a few magical words which, of course, he did.  Next day, the ruler, turning the amulet over in his hands, marveled at this humble object with the power to save him from all harm. On one of his whims, he ordered his remaining followers to throw him off the highest cliff. A few of them had tears in their eyesa surprise even to them.  Jojo Chansiri,  , 2023 The boy was the only passenger on the boat to the island of Busam. No one from the island of Neobor, where he lived, had ever traveled to Busam. The boy wanted to be the first. As the boat approached a sliver of beach, he saw gleaming skyscrapers of steel, concrete, and glass, rise to great heights on the edge of a mile-high vertical cliff. On the way up in the narrow glass-floored elevator carrying him to the town, he saw whimsical houses over the sea cling to the steep rock wall.  Cold stares of islanders on broad streets of smooth stone made it clear he was not welcome but he did not care. One street in particular aroused his curiosity when three men blocked him from passing. After some deliberation, the three men decided that this scrawny boy would pose no threat, so they allowed him to continue on his way, even though they knew he would come to the vast mine they kept secret, from which they extracted a rare and valuable ore. On second thought, to play it safe, one of the men, the spell-maker of Busam, removed from the deep pocket of his robe, full of amulets, a small dinosaur bone that would induce forgetfulness in the boybut this forgetfulness would not be   forgetfulness. Finally overwhelmed by the sights of Busam, the boy returned to the boat, eager to go home. But by the time he landed, he had forgotten everything he had seen. Excitedly, he described Busam as if it were Neobor, with a jumble of rickety tin-roofed shacks on uneven dirt streets so narrow he had to flatten himself against the walls of the dwellings to let anyone pass. Politely listening, the Neoborians wondered if Busam could possibly be that much like Neobor. Had he even been on Busam? Of course, had he been able, he would have told the Neoborians all about Busam but, of course, the spell-maker made sure he would not.

        "text": "Art by Roya Farassat Roya Farassat,  , 2020 acrylic on paper, 13.75 x 19.75 Her father named her Zahra.  Her mother calls her Zazu.  Her momani calls her Zahnushka.  But it was the third day of second grade and the teacher has taken to calling her Zara. Zara. Zara? Like the store? she asks. The girl is standing at the front of the classroom, looking up at the womans face trying to figure out how to fix the way her name sounds coming out of the womans mouth. She shakes her head.   Say it again? the woman asks. The girl doesnt want to. She thinks she says her name too much at this school and still, no one seems to get it. Its the   at the center that acts like a bump in peoples throats.  She doesnt know how to fix that so she shakes her head to say, No, thank you. I do not want to say my name again. She gives her teacher a limp smile andhead down and arms down, straight as sticksthe girl walks back to her desk. Some of the kids titter and snort, though it isnt clear if theyre laughing or if theyre embarrassed for the girl or for the teacher or if theyre all just relieved the moment is over.  The teacher snaps to attention. Alright, she says, alright. Settle down. Lets start. By the end of the week, the girl has given up. Shes   in the lunchroom, in music class, and on the playground. Everyone calls her  . Sitting in the middle seat of the bus, pushed up against the window, watching the others laugh together, the girl comes to a decision.  That night, as they are saying good night, she tells her mother what shes decided. Her mother looks away.  The next morning, the girl tells her father who pushes his lips together tightly and then kisses the top of her head.  Her brother Ramin, who doesnt care what anyone calls him, rolls his eyes and keeps eating his cereal.  The next Monday, the girl walks into the classroom holding a slip of paper. She hands it to the teacher.  Her teacher reads it and then she looks at her student, the child with dark brown eyes and tight curls pushed off her forehead with a red and blue plaid headband.  Are you sure? the teacher asks. The girl nods. And your parents know? The girl nods again.  OK, the teacher says, looking down. She then looks up, over the childs head at the clock. OK. Go put your things away and take your seat. When all thirty-two students are seated, the teacher clears her throat and starts the day, pointing to the schedule on the board. As the kids pull out their spelling workbooks, the teacher adds, almost as an afterthought. And another thing: Zaras going to go by Margerie now. The teacher is suddenly certain of one thing: years from now, this small girl would remember her. The teacher would be mentioned like a character in that childs story, a story told to a therapist, a friend, a partner.  But that day, none of the children seem bothered. The girl seems relieved, even happy. The morning turns to afternoon, and the recess bell rings.  The girl runs out with the other kids; she looks around the playground and the blacktop. She decides she doesnt much feel like four square or tag or whatever the kids were breaking off into groups to play.  Its a cool day in September but the sun is still warm, so she walks towards the clump of trees at the far end of the yard. She circles one tree, then another tree. She checks that no one is looking and then lies down carefully at the foot of the old maple. Her head cradled by the roots. The tufts of grass pricking and tickling the backs of her legs. She adjusts her body. She pushes her nose upward as if to touch the clouds. Her arms are slightly stretched out like wings at rest.  It feels as if the ground is pressing against her back and pushing her up, up, up into the sky. The sun turns the insides of her eyelids yellow and orange and red. She slowly moves her hands in front of her face, so their shadows roll over her like waves. Her only job, her only obligation in that moment, is to breathethe tree exhales air for her; she exhales carbon dioxide for it. A circle. Logical, masterful, contained. She isnt its center; she is just part of the whole.  She doesnt have the words for what shes feeling. She is just a part and apart; two parts is how she feels herself; she feels herself slide into place, a piece of a puzzle nestled against another piece of a puzzle. She is Zahra and she is Margerie. She blinks her eyes open and rolls to her side. She gets to her feet, shaking off the leaves and unpeels the helicopter seeds stuck to the back of her calves. The kids are shouting, running up and down the blacktop. No one noticed her communion. No one really notices her very much unless theyre forced to try.  She skips down to the playground and, for the rest of recess, twirls round and round on one of the metal poles that hold up the swing set. When the bell rings, children rush like ants from the far four corners of the yard, jostling into a line, each taking their place in the alphabetical order, before marching neatly into the school.  Everyone smelling faintly like dirt; Zahra is tucked away, Margerie still warmed from the sun Neda Toloui-Semnani is an Emmy award-winning journalist and author.

        "text": "Art by Samira Abbassy Samira Abbassy,  , 2022  Collage, Acrylic, gouache on card, 15\" x 11  Over the course of the past four decades, Iranians have had to endure numerous kinds of separations: from homeland, family, familiarity, and friendships. These distances have rarely caused a complete breakage from Iranquite the opposite: many Iranians have remained steadfast in their efforts to maintain ties with the people and things they hold dear, successfully bringing with them their music, culture, cuisine, and traditions to the societies they have joined in countries across the globe. While life away from Iran has meant that they cant physically be there, many Iranians in the diaspora remain deeply emotionally engaged with their home country. Whether they have been away for decades or a few short years, Iranians seem to have a deeply empathetic connection to Iranfeeling the pain of the country, becoming emotionally distressed when their fellow Iranians inside the country are dealing with crisis.  There is a familiar saying in Persian, commonly and sincerely used by Iranians all over the world; they say it after short or long separations from one another, or to convey that they have been in each others thoughts: Hearts have paths to one another,  . With regard to Iran and Iranians, it seems this path is set in stone and never fades. No matter how far they may go from home, when Iran is in crisis, one can almost hear the collective sorrow of Iranians, regardless of where they may be in this world at that moment.  Golafarin Razi was born in Tehran, Iran and raised in Tehrangeles (Los Angeles, California). Having spent her most of her life either in Iran or surrounded by one of the most well-known Iranian diaspora communities in the world  Iranian history, culture, arts and politics have become the tapestry of her life. Golafarin loves studying, discussing, and discovering new things about Iran.  Samira Abbassy  (b.1965 Ahwaz, Iran) graduated from Canterbury College of Art, Kent, UK. She moved to New York in 1998, where she co-founded the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts and EFA Studio Center. Abbassy is known for her figurative oil on gesso panel paintings depicting the human figure, mythological creatures, and scenes of war.

        "text": "Art by Samira Abbassy Samira Abbassy,   (from the   drawing series), 2021.  Charcoal on Somerset etching paper, 44\" x 30  Since probably the introduction of automobiles to Iran, there has been a story told of how car accidents take place in the country: Two cars, both probably at fault in some way, collide. Both drivers, infuriated at the other and incensed that any onlookers should even   the thought that they were the one at fault, fly their door open and begin yelling at the other driver. This is where it gets good:  Bystanders dont just stand gawking, they get involved they get in between the two drivers  one gets a glass of water,  someone yells that this is no matter to be fighting over, This world is only two days!  another insists they know an honest mechanic and minutes later the crowd has calmed the two drivers down, insisting they kiss each other on the cheek and the two are whispering words of friendship to each other amidst the crowd  Its just a scratch, It really was my fault,  And this beautiful cycle of crisis control repeats itself countlessly on a daily basis in every city and province of the country.  Now, you might be asking yourself, what does this have to do with the current state of things with regard to Iran? The implicit should be made clear for readers who arent aware of why the Iranians on the street felt compelled to do intercede in the first place:  . In the modern era, we have a different kind of traffic to consider, and a variety of other sorts of potential accidents to navigate: social media has created both a powerful platform and a collision course for Iranians that is proving to be an interesting study in how we organize and strategize for a women-led movement in the digital age. It should not be assumed that everyone will agree with the ideas presented about this unique and difficult moment in time; in fact, disagreements are welcomed and necessarythis is a time like no other, and yet, Iranians are accustomed to extraordinary times and circumstances. Since ancient times, Iranians have been pioneersinventors, and innovators, risk-takers and visionariesand this moment hearkens back to our collective history, whether we reside within Iran or are part of the diaspora. One thing to keep in mind is that when breaking new ground, or setting out on uncharted waters, the way forward is always uncertain, it may seem like every step forward is a step into the abyssbut weve been here before, and always survived.

        "author": "Laura Collins interviewed by Sarah Bridgins",
        "text": "Art by Laura Collins Laura Collins,  , 2019  16x20 in, acrylic on panel  I first discovered Laura Collins in 2017 when her series of paintings The Real Housewives Pointing Fingers was on exhibit at the Tonya Harding Nancy Kerrigan 1994 (THNK1994) museum in Brooklyn. The exhibit was exactly what it sounds like; a collection of paintings depicting scenes from episodes of the Bravo show   where the women pointed at various things including themselves and each other. Like any true   obsessive I have an ongoing text thread with my friends about the show, and one of them shared a link to Collinss work. As soon as I saw her painting of   I knew I had to have it. Not only had I never bought a piece of original art before, I had never spent that much money on pretty much anything. I showed my boyfriend a picture of the painting fully expecting him to talk me out of it. Instead, he said, Buy it. Itll make you happy. He was right. My portrait of Lisa Rinna hangs above my TV and five years later it still makes me so happy. It sounds absurd, but watching these women scream and sob at each other over stolen houses and stuffed bunny rabbits has helped me get through some of the most difficult times in my life. Never more so than during the height of the pandemic, when texting with my friends every Wednesday while we watched together was the social highlight of my week. Theres something about having a still from   permanently captured in a beautiful painting that legitimizes it; transforming it from a silly reality show into a subject worthy of veneration and study. Other subjects Collins has captured over the years in her paintings include, The Olsen Twins Hiding from the Paparazzi, Britneys Instagram Posts, and Runway Models Falling. Many of these have been exhibited in the THNK1994 museum whose curators shes had an ongoing relationship with since they exhibited her first show in 2016, and her work has been written about everywhere from   to  . I interviewed Collins about her pop-culture diet, the other artists that inspire her, and what shes working on next.   Left: Laura Collins,  , 12x12 in, acrylic on panel    Right: Laura Collins,  , 12x12 in, acrylic on panel We met after I submitted a painting of Tonya Hardings mugshot to their museum. We hit it off and they offered to show my Olsen Twins Hiding from the Paparazzi series in New York in 2016. We have been working together ever since and we have more great shows to come!  There is something really fascinating about reality TV. Without a script, it feels like anything can happen. I love making art that references reality TV because it allows me to see the show differently. Making paintings is my way of memorializing. I like the idea of making a trivial moment on television feel grand and iconic. Laura Collins,  , 2020,  11 x 14 in, oil on linen I feel like transforming one medium into another extends the life of the subject. When painting moments from TV, I feel like I am adding to the narrative and altering the way a viewer experiences the work. It also complicates the subject and makes it more interesting to me. I hope that my viewers feel the same way. Lately, I have been spending a bit more time on my paintings and each one takes a day or two. I still try not to spend too much time on any given work because I do not want the painting to feel stiff or overworked. Its really important to keep the painting feeling light and effortless. Of course, sometimes that is easier said than done. Laura Collins,  , 2016,  12x16 in, acrylic on panel As a very self-conscious person, I am fascinated to see the way that celebrities present themselves to the public. Especially in todays world where we are encouraged to share everything on social media, I spend a lot of time thinking about the filters we use to present the best version of ourselves. By filters I mean both literal filters that can be used to enhance a photo, and the ways that we choose to filter our lives to give the illusion of perfection. I wonder how much of this is healthy. Celebrities often take self-improvement to the extreme by physically altering their appearance, but we can still always look back at old photos to see how they used to appear. I am interested in the ways we all work to present ourselves a certain way. I love working with Bravo! I was able to chat with Dorinda on the phone at one of my openings and she was incredibly sweet. A few other housewives, including Sonja, have reposted my paintings on social media. Its always such a thrill to get positive feedback from my subjects themselves. It has really been a joy to work with them. Left: Laura Colins,  ,  9x12 in, mixed media  Right: Laura Collins,  , 9x12 in, mixed media I certainly hope that women today are treated better by the media but Im not so sure. Women are certainly still judged for their physical appearance and are hounded by paparazzi. I hope that there is more body positivity today and that celebrities are not preyed upon by the media. When Britney posted those merely identical selfies on her Instagram I was spellbound. I couldnt believe she would post all of them, rather than just choosing her favorite. Taking the time to draw each one in colored pencil was my way of highlighting the repetition of the posts.  Laura Collins,  , 2018  16x20 in, acrylic on panel I like the crossover between politicians and celebrities. With social media, politicians are more in the public eye than ever and I am interested in the ways they present themselves to the world to gain votes. I started making collages in one of my collage drawing classes. At the time, I was working on large oil paintings that took months to make. Taking time off to make quick collages was a welcome reprieve. Today, collage is a big part of my practice. I source my images from old textbooks and womens magazines from around the 1950s.  Laura Collins,    oil on linen, 24x48 in Andy Warhol is my favorite artist. He was focused on the circulation of media images and pop culture. I also love the works of David Hockney. I admire Alex Katzs simple paint application and bold compositions. I also enjoy looking at paintings by Elizabeth Peyton and Karen Kilimnick.  I spend my spare time scrolling Instagram and TikTok. This is where I find most of my image inspiration. The algorithm has figured out that I like images of Princess Diana and Britney Spears, so thats what I look at all day.   I am currently working on a hand-drawn animation of Britney Spears and my hope is that it will make its debut sometime next year.

        "title": "The Festering Mirror: The NYC Photography of Nancy Hightower  Evergreen Review",
        "author": "Nancy Hightower interviewed for ",
        "text": "Dr. Nancy Hightower is an author, teacher, and photographer who has been taking pictures of New York City in standing water, showing the living city in the reflection of stagnant puddles, finding her light among the floating trash and foul odors. Her mind-bending photos of NYC as literal scum tell the story of the city during and after the pandemic better than mere angry or desperate words ever could: the beautiful images capture hope in the medium of our empty streets and waiting buildings. We are all still alive here in the festering mirror.  I doubt I would have noticed them except that NYC came to a standstill in March 2020. I was living in a dorm room in a seminary, and I didnt think I could survive the isolation except to walk the very empty streets of Chelsea. Except they werent as empty as I thought. Stoop culture, ever a fixture in NYC, was taken to a new level. Shoes and food were left out, yes, but also tea sets, incense sticks, bowling balls, and unicorn hats. What might have been weekly offerings became daily. I came to appreciate the strange whimsy my neighbors had when setting out their wares.   That year trained me to look down at the street rather than straight ahead or at my phone. It taught me to be more present while walking. But it wasnt until 2021, when the stores and restaurants really starting opening up, that I walked outside of my little grid. It also rained a lot more. In fact, 2021 was one of the rainiest years on recent record. And looking down into those giant puddles, I saw another world. The first was this giant puddle at Union Square at the golden hour, and I was transfixed.   I had gotten my dress pretty drenched trying to take a picture of the Empire State Building through a pavement puddle on a rainy night. Umbrella in one hand and camera in the other, I managed to get maybe ten shots after about twenty minutes. Walking back home through the Flatiron District, I saw another puddle and started circling it, but I was also feeling wet and cold and really didnt want to crouch down beside it. I didnt realize a trio (two women and a man) were watching me. When asked what I was doing, I explained how I wanted to capture the magic of the city through puddle reflections, and then showed them some photos on my phone.  They said they had a little group that discussed how to reclaim magic and wonder in their life, and they were meeting that Friday. Would I like to come? I said sure and met them at a restaurant in the Upper West Side. They seemed to love my prints and asked me all sorts of questions about my process. But by the end of our time together, I realized they had only given me first names and when we said goodbye, I wondered if I would ever see them again (I havent). As if that wasnt strange enough, on my walk home from 127 on 72nd Street, I took 7th Avenue down to Times Square, and at 7:22 p.m. I looked up and saw that it was 72 degrees. A strange little shiver went through me. Of course I believe in coincidence, but I also wonder if NYC really is a thin space for those looking.  I look for puddles, as I would have to crane my neck while walking to see the full scope of most high-rises. But then I would also seem like an irritating tourist slowing down foot traffic. Whereas the puddle shows me the tops of the buildings first (so I look down to gaze up). Ive discovered so much fascinating architecture this way and now see NYC buildings as a kind of forest.  I have absolutely no training. I started taking pictures of readings when I was helping Andrew Lloyd Jones run Liars League, and then afterwards took pictures of literary events put on at the Coffee House club. I learned a few things about light and angles, since you want to post pictures of people that theyll like. So Ive been slowly learning over the past few years how to take a good photo from whatever phone I have.  The only other city Ive tried is Chicago, and it was tough because it had rained, but the puddles were in parking lots and too big to really act as a frame. I did get one on the side of the road that was spectaculara building appears to be disintegrating in this post-apocalyptic space, and its still one of my favorite photos.  I have a standing invitation to Boston by a friend who wants me to look for puddlescapes there, but its hard to predict when it will truly rain enough, and also, if there will be areas of standing water from street washing and construction (which is where NYC gets its standing water from).  Ive mostly done Manhattan since I live there and walk a lotusually five or six miles a day.  At first, I took self-portraits using broken and cast-off mirrors everyone set out during the worst of the pandemic in 2020. So many people fled the city, and effect of these broken mirrors reveal the shattered, fractured state most of us were living in.  Ive tried to take pictures of buildings that reflect other buildings, often more than one, but the effect just wasnt the samenot enough warping or strangeness to make it visually interesting. Maybe Im just not picking the right buildings.  It depends on several factors, like how many cars are whizzing by me, or might want the parking spot. Ive gotten a shot just as a car was pulling in, or during the last few minutes of sunset. The other night I was trying to get the Empire State Building on Fifth Avenue, but bicyclists were flying past me every other minute, and one went right through the puddle so I got splashed pretty good. Then again, theyre not on the lookout for a woman kneeling over a puddle at 10 p.m., so I cant really fault them.  Usually, I will spend around ten minutes trying to get whatever I can. Even during the day, its not great to be hunched over a puddle for an extended period of time (which Ive done while waiting for the wind to die down or people to pass). My purse tends to stick out behind me while Im taking the shot. Im amazed no one has lifted my wallet yet. Bike lanes challenge and delight me because the green paint adds to the puddle texture, and I never quite know what Ill get. The same holds for the puddles near trees because multicolored leaves cascade over the buildings in a surreal way come fall. Smaller puddles actually create a more dynamic frame and force me to really work at getting a narrative. Sometimes a puddle is so big and still that it really is more of a mirror, and thats when I do a split shot.  Yes! The puddles along the High Line or around the Upper East Side drain within the hour unless its a big rain. The building above the Starbucks on Eighth and Greenwich has these gorgeous blue-green windows that look otherworldly in a puddle, but theres rarely one big enough to get it.  Some places also have great puddles but horrible environmental conditions. The Google building has the most minty green windows Ive ever seen in a puddle, but its right on Eighth Avenue, and between wind and cars wanting to park there, Ive yet to get a good shot. At some point I want to make a puddle map of NYC. I cant imagine trying to take a photograph of a moving reflection. Although I find that I can make buildings jump from car to car, and I wonder if I should experiment with video.  Not really. I mean, I find myself at odds with most churches that wont confront their own white supremacy. But I am equally at odds with the academic world for much of the same reason. In that sense I feel adrift without a community I can really call home. I follow people like the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II or Bree Newsome on Twitter because they show me how to include their spirituality into their fight for justice.  Sometimes when Im cropping those split-world photos I have to look closely to see which one is the puddle and which is the real place, which surprises me. For me, the simulation gets us more interested and invested in the real place. People say my pictures make them miss New York or helps them appreciate its magic on those days the city feels gray and suffocating. So often we are rushing to work or to meet someone and are only vaguely aware of our surroundings. Puddles slow me down and reinvent what I know of the city. Even the same puddle can show me a different world because of light or leaves, a piece of trash. Sometimes Im bent over a puddle for so long that I have to blink hard and shake my head to remind myself where I am (because NYC can turn into Middle Earth in some cases, or a futuristic sci-fi novel in others).  Ive argued for a while now that wonder is found in the mundane, and that beauty can be at the center of what we apprehend first only as trash. The split-world cover photo on the latest issue of   magazine came from one of the foulest smelling puddles that Ive encountered. I immediately had to throw my clothes into a separate bag for the laundry, they smelled so bad. But that photo really won peoples hearts, and everyone started calling it Batmans NYC. The purple effect came from a glitch in my camera as it was going into night mode. So it was accident upon accident that created something beautiful. The grotesque is something more than this, of course, because it has to have some aspect of horror, and I really dont think my art holds that level of fear in any real way. I follow Elizabeth Bourne and Adrianna Amari on Facebook. Both of them do fantastic nature photography. I really appreciate what they do with focus and color.  I wish I could say I was writing, but that stalled a bit this year with a move and taking on more adjunct teaching to pay the bills. I have a series of reworked fairytales and folklore I need to get back to. Ive come to appreciate the graffiti that has cropped up in Chelsea since 2020, especially when the same artwork appears in several places. People also leave shoe pairings all around Chelsea in various positions. I see them at least once a week. During peak pandemic it got to be almost once a day. I have a healthy and respectful fear of invasive species because Ive seen what they do in the plant world. Still, I was feeling torn. One night at dinner, we were sitting next to some bushes and the lanternflies kept landing on me with a kind of thud, like they were mini bats. So now Im totally on board with killing them, pretty as they are.  I dont think anyone would ever say roach, and the only fun rat is Pizza Rat, so Ill go with the raccoons in Central Park.  I still dont understand how to work Instagram, and my photos always get more love on Facebook. I also dont believe that social media platforms destroy the fabric of our lives. They merely fill in the gap left by the absence of other things. I used to have a community I saw in real life weekly. Now its monthly, or every other month, or perhaps twice a year. Did IG or FB create that distance? I doubt it, but I feel the disconnect. I post drafts of my photos on IG story just to get a sense of what it might look like. Then I usually post on Facebook to get another set of reactions, and then I put it into my Picfair store. I also stringently curate most of these platforms to give me news and essays that I can bring to my students. Neither! I am more terrified that Ill drop my phone into the puddle. I have already lost countless gloves and masks that way.

Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1989, enamel, found wood on panel, 48 x 50 x 2 inches I left Flanagan on a wet afternoon. He had just received advance copies of his preposterous book of essays,  ! And as I headed out with my suitcase in my hand and several of Flanagans credit cards in my wallet, he called after me, Wait! Its dedicated to you!  So, when I was eighteen or so, I lived for some months in glamorous Beverly Hills. Dick the famous actor took me in, gave me my own rooma corner room with gorgeous leaded windows that overlooked the gardenand the place had antique mahogany furniture, rose-colored wallpaper, squat brass table lamps with cloth shades. He allowed me to use one of the cars. He bought me clothes: wool sweaters in pastel colors, tailored slacks, crisp shirts, and ties and gloves and overcoats. Dick the famous actors real passion was shoes, though, and after some weeks I had a closet quite full of them. And then I, too, developed this love of shoes; I absorbed his delight, his fascination with them, and understood its logic: each pair demanded a different stride, a different stance. Shoes are the foundation and they define the entire attitude, the worldview. With endless choices regarding shoes, one can adopt a new, complete personality. What shall I be today? Elegant, energetic, thoughtful, needy or assured or flighty? It all depends on shoes. (At twenty, of course, my limp was not yet so pronounced. Today I can only wear plain, black, Navy oxfords.)  Dick the famous actor liked to dress me up and parade me around, but he mostly liked for me to stay at the pool, bare and greasy from suntan lotion, stretched out lazily on one of the wooden deck chairs. He brought me cocktails. He brought me magazines. He liked to serve me. Serving me was Dick the famous actors way of being served by me.  And then I was kept by another actor; and then I was in a few porno films; and then I had an affair with a doctor; and then I lived for a while in Berlin, then in Paris; and then I went back to Dick the famous actor, and by this time we each had a considerable heroin habit. I stole the most expensive of his shoes. I stole his car. I left town. Someone fell in love with me. Someone else fell in love with me. Is anyone listening?  (And then one night I saw a reflection of myself. It was my twenty-first birthday. I was staying with a Dutch guy in Manhattan, and as I was closing the medicine cabinet after searching it for drugs to steal, there were my eyes in the mirror. So tired and sad, like chocolate melting on the sidewalk of Asylum Street, like Mamas hurt, resigned eyes. This vision of myself came upon me quite unexpectedly, caught me in the actmyself as thief, hustler, liar, and, somehow most bruising, myself as tireless, rushed, infinitely hungry. Except for red hair and white skin, I could see no reminder of Aunt Joy, my heroine, in my reflected image. Nothing of her in me. Once there was something of hers I wanted. Once I had sat cross-legged on the floor, she had sung to me, I had loved her. What is the   with you? I asked the thin, dead face in the mirror. I almost cried but was in too much of a hurry to cry.)  It is terrifying, I guess, to be without any values. Moral direction, however it is measured, described, interpreted, makes us feel safe. So, for that to be absent is fundamentally painful. So, that I am a man who says, NoI do   knowI do not   caremakes me some kind of monster. A modern monster.  We are nowhere near Armageddon, despite the asinine ramblings of the bible doomsayers. Were not even close to real decay. Well know its all over when people simply do not believe in   anymore.  In a highway restaurant outside of Toledo, Ohio those old days seem so long ago, and I remember them sadly, fondlya black-and-white television, perched precariously above the counter, blared a news report of an epidemic: little old ladies were being brutally assaulted and robbed on Toledos streets. The newscastersome fag with a concerned pancake-face and stiff hairgave a sketchy description of a pair of thugs and warned elderly women citizens not to go out alone or at night.  Jed had stopped eating his cheeseburger to listen to the report. God, thats awful. Isnt that awful, Holly?  I dont know. No, really. Beating up little old ladies? It happens, Jed. All kinds of things happen. But ... I know that, but, I mean, some of them are bad. Thats all Im saying. I told him to finish lunch. Later, in the car, this dialoguewhich thrilled me, really, but which I pretended was only an irritationcontinued.  Holly, cant you admit that there are wrong, bad, immoral types of things that happen? No. I wont admit that at all. There are just things that happen. What about child abusers and alcoholics and racists, et cetera? Dont use the word  . All right, yes, there are such people. Are you looking for someone to blame for something?  No, Im just trying to say ... well, what about like creepy things like incest or whatever?  Yes. That exists.  What about if they take some man and put electrical wires on his dick and shock him and then nail his balls to a wall?  Well, Jed, what   that? By now I was somewhat exasperated.  He raised his hands and slapped his thighs in desperate frustrationalmost like he was trying to teach a stupid little boy the alphabet. I mean, come on, wouldnt you say that would be a really creepy, gross, awful thing?  Maybe. Maybe some men would actually like it.  Now youre just playing games or something, Holly, youre just trying to seem like you dont care about anything. Which I thought was quite perceptive. His beauty was absolute at that momentthe pouting lips, the black hair fallen across his brow, the eyes: green for a second, gray for a second. By Toledo, I loved Jed.  Oh, no. Here is Julius. Holly? Oh my  , it   you. May I join you, dear?  I nod at the chair across from me and Julius settles himself into it. One has to be in just the right mood for Julius, something specific, predisposed to quick bantering and superficial observations. Julius has his own unique worldviewbut then, at the same time, I think it is a very obvious, predictable one. He is despicable, he is conservative, bigoted, petty, somehow not even real; and yet, because he makes no apologies, he can be incomparably entertaining. The breadth of his ability and willingness to insult is often delightful. When I am at all fragile, though, I simply cannot handle Julius.  Oh, I see Miss Flanagan is here with her bevy of academic types. Dont you just hate that? So, how   you, anyway? Julius has a canary-yellow, floral-print ascot and his hair is streaked with fake blond color. I havent seen you in ages, darling. I was thinking about you just the other day because those two lesbian sisters who always give the art parties had a little dinner, and I looked around, looked around, I was asking people, Wheres Holly?  Ill tell you the truth, Julius confides, I wondered if you hadnt gotten AIDS and dropped dead.   glad to see youre not dead, dear.  I smile. No. Somehow I managed to avoid that particular virus.  Its a crapshoot, sweetheart. It is. It surely is. Anyway, he continues. You know that new boyfriend Wayne has been dragging around everywhere? Well, my dear, turns out hes a heroin addict. They havent had sex in months.  . Waynes one of those obsessive types, he likes to take care of the poor, beautiful losers. There was that other one named Lawrence or something who sold all of Waynes books, you remember him. All Waynes priceless signed first editions, worth a fortuneI mean Burroughs, Isherwood, and all those faggot poets and everyonejust   them. Waynes a mess. I told him so. I said, Wayne, darling, youre tiring out all your friends. Everyone thinks youre a stupid cunt. Julius has eyes that are never fully open, the lids  linger, droop. He says Im looking so well these days which is certainly not trueand I return the compliment with a strained smile. All of my smiles are strained.  He sips an ominous-looking drink, a cloudy copper colored concoction. He lights a cigarette. I guess by now youve heard what happened to Conway.  I heard he had died. In Paris, was it?  It was Berlin, my dear.   a pleasant place to die. You know, Conway was a diabetic but also a vicious alcoholic. So, yes, of course, he died, yes, but have you heard the whole  ?  I do not reply.  Julius leans in closer, affecting a strategy of cozy confidence. It was a suicide.   of. Conway was involved in some very shady things, namely selling syringes to horrid black-market people. Selling drugs, too, and he kept riding back and forth to Europe on the Concorde, and he hooked up with this very, very wealthy Brazilian woman called Belva or something and her Jewish husband and they were just about as reckless as you can be with all the drugs and the money and everything. This was last year. I was living with Peterwho by now, you know, was never faithful to me for one day, not for one goddamn day. And he   to be an artist and he kept talking about his art dealers and his galleries. He was doing these huge canvases with pictures of erect penises in   colors, just awful, no integrity or depth.  But the story of poor Conway. This Belva and her rich Brazilian Jewish husband hired Conwayif you can call it hiring. They convinced him to write a play for them. It was supposed to be a pornographic musical, a sadomasochistic thing, with lesbians and masturbation. You know. And all those kinds of things are   tired, but Conway was in such a state hed do any goddamn thing for money. So, this Belva and her husband commissioned Conway to work on this play and they made big promisesit would be done for German television, a lot of money was supposed to be involved. And Conway, naturally, was all excited, just thrilled, and gloating and bragging. Hed say, Oh, I have to work on my piece. He kept calling it his piece. Isnt that vulgar?  Well, my dearoh, sweethearthe curls a finger to flag a waiterlet me have another of these, will you? Anyway, these crazy Brazilian Jewish monsters ended up locking Conway in a tower of a castleand I am   kidding, a real tower in one of those insane castles in the middle of the German countryside, in the goddamn middle of nowhere. And they   let him out. It was like a sick sort of game. They didnt give him an ounce of food. Just orange juice and amphetamine, amphetamine and orange juice. And they forced him to write and write, this pornographic musical play. Conway worked away, worked away, and then Belva and her husband would say, Oh, this isnt right, Conway, this isnt what we had in mind, and hed write and write some more. Three weeks of this, mind you.  It was all a big joke to Belva and her Brazilian Jew, you know. They love to torment people. They love to come up with these ideas and manipulate everyone into working on their atrocious projects. Not that Conway didnt have his part in this whole arrangement. He wrote me one letter. From the tower of this castle. I dont know where Ive put that letter, but it was  , just utterly  . He told me how he was so loaded on the speed they kept giving him and they wouldnt let him leave, and then he said, well, he wasnt sure he really even wanted to leave. Things like that. He wrote that they wouldnt allow him clothing and it was very cold, but being naked and so cold was helping him to write this play. And this Belva person would come in his little tower room, the little garret or whatever it was, to tell him that she did not like what hed written so far, it wasnt right. And then this brute woman would say, Dont you want to get it  , Conway?  Anyway, the end result of this sick, sick,   story is that Conway slaved away, a virtual prisoner, and eventually one day he simply hopped out the tower window. Or, rather, theres some question about whether he jumped himself or was pushed by Belva or the Brazilian Jew or both. He was naked when he was found all twisted up on a pile of rocks at the bottom of this castle. So, naturally, there are any number of revolting scenarios that run through ones mind. But Belva told everyone, from the coroners office to the cocktail parties, that Conway was just terribly depressed and vitamin-deficient and had just impulsively killed himself in this fit of despair. No one knew what to believe, so the whole thing got very neatly wrapped up.  Well, as you know, Holly, Conway was absolutely my oldest and dearest friend, so this whole episode was enormously traumatic for me. And now some German queen wants to write a book about the whole thing, like a fictionalized account of this business, and Belva was talking to Andre and some other people about how shes considering the movie options.  . Can you imagine? Have you ever heard anything so grotesque?  Im thinking, Oh, well, yes, yes I have.  Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1989, enamel and oil on wood, 48 x 48 inches Holly was lots of things to me in my life, but first and most he was my teacher. We went through all this stuff, the traveling and fighting, all the love we had and stuff, but some little piece of me always still did think of him as my teacher, always will.  See, what happened, by the time I reached the eighth grade, Lila had had it. Thats what she said. I have just   it with you. The remark didnt sting much by that time. By thirteen years old I was pretty tough, actually.  Id stopped faking sickness; now I just wasnt bothering to show up to classes. I was hanging out with this weird, ugly girl named Ceil who had thick glasses and buck teeth. Her ambition was to be a prostitute. Also, she was pretty seriously into witchcraftshe read a lot about it and said these little incantations and everything. Once she put a hex on her stepfather. Ceil and I would smoke cigarettes together under the bleachers and drink wine. Ceil threw up a lot.  Actually, it was a rather upper-class sort of world I was raised in. Everyone lived in these ranch-type houses, but not the tacky kind. The sprawling, rich-looking kind with wide, winding driveways. I thought those driveways had a rather mournful sense about them, actually. All the kids parents were divorced, all the kids got stoned on something or other. The kids were fucking all over the place or whatever and one time, even, a teacher at the high school got fired for fucking a girl student. It was a decadent community, I guess youd say. Way ahead of its time.  Ceil and I pored over dirty magazinesnot like those glossy kind you get in drug stores, but the really sleazy ones with she-males and ads for dildos and everything, and wed just be stoned and laughing. One daywe were pretty stoned, because wed taken ten or fifteen of those over-the-counter caffeine pillsI dared Ceil to take her shirt off in the cafeteria and she did. She had these white white breasts with pink ends, and she just sat there, half-naked. The other kids were pretty damn shocked and startled, I must say. I must say, I was a pretty manipulative sort of kid, I think, daring Ceil to do something like that.  Also, I was pretty much what you might call chronic as far as masturbation goes. What I was doing was masturbating in different locations; for some reason I was really fascinated with the idea of masturbating in all the rooms of the house, the backyard, the garage, the bathroom at school. When we went out anywhere Lila took me to plays sometimes, and sometimes to restaurants, once in a while even to a dinner party of one of her friendsId find the bathroom and masturbate. Partly, I was fascinated with my own dick, which is kind of a weirdly embarrassing thing to admit. Every time I saw it or touched itevery timeId get that jabbing jolt of pleasure. Which I cant really explain. And so then masturbating in these different places made the whole sensation stronger, more intense, dreamier, etc. I thought maybe I was a pervert, but then that idea kind of got me excited, too.  I dont know. I think masturbating all over the place was, actually, in a weird way, comforting. To be in a new place, doing an old thing. Masturbating was comforting because it was familiar, like the only really familiar thing in my whole life. Later, when I told Holly about my perversion, he said it was like a dog marking.  So, my motherI have   it with you. Not because of masturbation; she didnt know about all that. It was too many notes home from teachers, too many phone calls from the principal and vice-principal and all those types of people, and finally they expelled me from the school, which was a snooty private middle school so they could kick you out if they wanted to.  Lila was sitting on her brand new mauve sofa, which cost five million dollars or something, swirling her martini around and sucking her cigarette and saying how disappointed in me she was. See, the principal had called her that afternoon, right in the middle of one of her board of directors things, for the art museum or whatever. I   suppose it even   to you that I was in a   meeting. I dont   it matters to you at  . And she went on and on about how inconsiderate I was, always had been, etc., and finally I couldnt take it, a sense of the injustice of it all overwhelmed me. I really think kids are much more sensitive to unfairness.  I said, rather loud, Look, do you think I like to be messing up in school? Hasnt it ever occurred to   that maybe Im   or something? See, it was just like back in fourth grade, way back, seemed like centuries before, when I tried to ask my mother for help, to tell her the truth about me.  Oh, youre troubled are you? Her legs were tucked under her bottom on the mauve sofa and she began rubbing the soles of her stockinged feet with her hand. Troubled? Troubled? Well, weve all got troubles, mister. I mean, if you think youve got troubles now.... She was having a fit or something, she was all red. She stubbed out her cigarette, her hand was trembling, and then she closed her eyes and took a few huge breaths. She whispered to herself, with her eyes closed, I am serene. I am serene. I am serene. See, Lila had joined this weird group where they meditated and told themselves they were serene all the time, even though they were all practically certifiable neurotics or whatever.  All right, she finally said to me, when shed opened her eyes. Heres what youre going to do. Youre going to go up to your room and clean it.  I must have rolled my eyes or something. I mean, her solution to everything was always to clean.  Thats right, mister. And I dont mean straighten up or tidy up. You  , mister. Spotless. That bed made. Every item of clothing folded or hung. The rugs shaken. The windows washed. All of it  . Like your life depends on it, mister. Understand? She lit another cigarette and then she took this box that was on the floor beside her, opened it fiercely, and inside was a ridiculous black hat with a wide brim and a white sash, and she put on the hat. She just put on the hat. I thought maybe shed gone crazy, right in front of my eyes. Her kids got all these problems, drinking and smoking and hanging around with crazy Ceil, and then he gets expelled; and all Lila could think to do was have me clean my room while she sat alone wearing a new hat. I am serene, she fumed.  Ronald Lockett,  , c. 1990, enamel on wood panel, 48 x 32 1/2 inches So, there were quite a few more messy scenes involving my mother, myself, and her fourth husband, Mr. Levine. Mr. Levine used to be a rabbi but then he invented a little gadget that increases the efficiency of Xerox machines or something. He became a millionaire. Theyd have these private talks in their bedroom about what should be done with me, and then theyd call me in. Mr. Levine would stand next to the bureau, fiddling with his cuff links and whatever. He must have felt rather weird, actually. I mean, he hardly knew me, and here he was all embroiled in this adolescent stuff. Anyway, Lila did all the talking. I just sat picking at threads on her expensive chaise lounge.  Finally, Lila hit on a solution. What weve decided, Jed, is to arrange a tutor for you. This person will come right here to the house and you will study privately. It seems you are too distracted at schoolshe took a violent drag of her cigaretteyoure restless. Obviously, youre more advanced than the other students, and the teachers do not challenge you. So, Morris that was Mr. Levineand I have agreed that a tutoring situation would be appropriate for right now, for this stage of your education. We have talked it over at some length and ... Will you   picking at that upholstery! she barked at me, and I jumped, and Mr. Levine jumped too.  Anyway, so this is how Hollis Flood and I came to meet. That day seems like so long ago. I was standing in the kitchen with our new maid, Eliza. She was practically only a kid herself, seventeen or so. Shed just been working for us a couple of weeks. Eliza was Amish. Lila hated her and made sarcastic remarks, paid her next to nothing. Eliza was nice enough but real timid. She wore a plain gray dress and a white apron and white bonnet. I dont really know what the Amish life is like or anything. I mean, I know they make cheese and everything. Eliza walked in on me naked in the bathroom once, and I even had half a hard-on, and she screamed, she literally screamed, she literally went running down the hallway, threw the towels shed been carrying, and kind of pulled her apron up over her head.  Anyway, that morning, I had my ear against the kitchen door, trying to hear Lila interviewing this new tutor. They were in the living room. Shed say something too soft, hed say something, and then she would laugh. And she kept saying, How delightful, Mr. Flood. Thats most impressive, Mr. Flood.  I never have found out exactly what tricks he used on my motheror, actually, what tricks she used on him. But they seemed to be getting along, they seemed to have some kind of weird understanding, which is all the weirder considering how things turned out.  Eventually, I was called in to meet Holly. I marched slowly across our long rose-colored carpet, toward the two of them seated on the sofa like royalty or movie stars or something. Like I should have bowed or something.  Well, here he is, Lila exclaimed flashing her broad, phony grin. Jed, this is your new tutor, Mr. Flood.  Good morning, Jed, Holly said. I said, Hi. I hated him. Lila turned daintily toward Holly and wondered,  Wouldnt you like some more tea, or a scone, perhaps?  Holly rosehe was so tall above me then, like a giantand took his cane, which had been leaning against the glass and marble coffee table. No, thank you, Mrs. Levine. I think Jed and I had better get acquainted. Very soft spoken, direct. Will you show me the way, Jed?  I shrugged. Yeah, sure, okay. So, I did hate him when I first met him. But, you know how people always say that adolescents are always acting out, trying to get attention by being bad and everything, but what theyre really doing is crying for help? Well, I think theres a lot of truth to that. I did want to be helped, I really did. So, some little piece of my brain or heart or guts or whatever saw Holly as the answer to a prayer. Which I didnt even know Id been praying. If that makes any sense.  Holly followed me up the front stairs, through the second-floor corridor, past the bedrooms and baths to the back of the house, down three steps into the room we called the solarium, a gigantic square room with floor-to-ceiling windows and a green tile floor. Lila had set it up for us to use as a schoolroom. There were a large wrought iron and glass table for studying, a few walnut bookcases, a rolltop desk for Holly, and an antique school desk for me. Also, Lilas old hi-fi set was in there, and some scratched up classical music records. She had thrown in some other school-type stuff: a globe, a chalk board, pads of construction paper, and notebooks and pencils.  Holly looked around the place. This will do just fine, he said. What do   think, Jed?  I didnt answer. I sat down at my desk and folded my hands.  Then Holly made this gesture, which Ive now seen him do thousands of times, maybe millions: he puts the ring finger of his right hand onto the very outside corner of his left eye (if you can picture that; its the weirdest kind of motion to make). Then rubs a tiny, delicate circle and sighs softly, like hes just exhausted. He blinks.  Holly had an unusual teaching method, his own sort of style, very vivid. He believed in concentrating on people rather than subjects. So, for example, we studied Emily Bronte, who wrote  . So we read the book, of course, and then we read some stuff about Emily Bronte and her sisters and then some stuff about Victorian England and the history and all of that. And then it got extendedthats Hollys term; he always was saying, Extend it, extend it, take it as far as you can. He can be really dramatic and everything. So, for example, we were reading about Catherine and Heathcliff and the moors and the heather and all of that and Holly asked me, Do you know what heather is? Do you know what the moors are? So, we got these books about the English countryside and vegetation and wildflowers. And every word we came across that I didnt know, we looked up and wrote down the definition. I remember I had never heard the word   before, and if youve ever read   you know theres actually quite a lot of morose in there. Some other words I remember even until this day  , which means  , and  , which means  . Also,  ,  ,  ,  .  Anyway,   led Holly to start talking about narrative, different voices telling the story, and then about literature and authors who experimented with these weird sorts of techniques and how when movies got invented it changed how people related to reading and to stories. So from this one book, I got a whole education.  Thats what happened with other people we studied, too. We listened to Duke Ellington and then read all about popular music and the recording industry and then racism and civil rights. It went on that way when we studied different painters, writers, musicians, scientists. One idea would lead to another, one book would lead to another.  There were some people Holly would not discuss. Mark Twain is an utter bore. If you want to read Mark Twain, do it on your own time; the same with Gertrude Stein. These people are frauds. And he didnt know a thing about any music after about 1950 or so.  Holly had a rather complicated theory about what really matters and what really does not matter. It all seemed arbitrary to me, I never could figure his logic. Truth mattered to Holly. But also, he was so full of contradictions, and you just couldnt argue with him. Id get frustrated, Id see how he wasnt consistent, he wasnt fair. Kids really depend on things being fair.  But, of course. Thats the truth. People and things never   consistent, Jed. Life isnt   fair. He looked at me like question marks were plastered on his wide, dark, kind of crazy eyeballs; and the question, always, was, Do you understand?  Bo Huston was born in Chagrin Falls, OH, in 1959. After Hampshire College, he lived in Manhattan, where he got clean and sober and started writing. Bo moved to San Francisco in 1987 and, within a year, learned he was HIV+. Over the next too-short years, he lived and wrote and found a partner and a community of friends who loved him fiercely. He died May 24, 1993, surrounded by family and friends, at a time of his choosing. His last book,  , and an essay in Thomas Avenas collection   were published posthumously. His novel   was republished this year by the  , with a new afterword by Rebecca Brown, a contemporary of Bos he much admired.  The Bo Huston Prize  is an annual award to a writer completing a novel. Ronald Lockett  (1965-1998) was slight of build and sentient to the point of grace. Lockett existed somewhat precariously in a historical crossroads between two generations, after the great mid-century social movements had ended and just before the dominance of television and urban culture. He was a unique talent, influenced equally by Thornton Dial and Bob Ross, who he watched on television. He grew up in the wilds of post-industrial Bessemer, Alabama where he lived with his mother until her death, remaining in his childhood home until his own untimely demise resulting from AIDS-related illness. He never spent more than a few weeks away from home, but was able to mine far-flung histories, both personal and shared, with deference and aplomb. ",

        "text": "Art by Taravat Talepasand The dog is a male, uncut as far as she can see. Whether he knows she is a female, whether in his eyes a human being must belong to one of two genders, corresponding to the two genders of dogs, and therefore whether he feels two kinds of satisfaction at oncethe satisfaction of one beast dominating another beast, the satisfaction of a male dominating a femaleshe has no idea.   A sun hides in a single atom. When that atom opens its mouth,  The sun springs forth in ambush! The heavens and the earth crumble before it into atoms! Why must the soul be confined in one body? Pay heed, O Body! Wash your two hands of this soul. Stop being the souls lodging. How long can the sea survive within a waterskin?   Taravat Talepasand,  , 2018  Egg tempera and collage on linen, 22 x 15 inches I was raised in America as an Iranian girl. By which I mean I was appraised as a particle that absorbs and emits the light of others: in my case, my parents, my mother as well as my father. To them, I am the human embodiment of an electron, and, as such, I carry a negative charge. When I stopped serving my parentswhen I refused to serve, when I lacked or lost the energy structure to take them in and scatter their frequenciesI was neglected. Neglect was not just a matter of convenience; it was necessary for their continuance. They had to seek other sources to carry their light or theyd be dimmed. Quantum physics, the study of atomic relationships outside the realm of general relativity, insists that point of viewthe moment of observationaffects and disturbs phenomena: Schrdingers cat is both alive and dead until we check on her. As a living Iranian daughter, instead of being dead or alive, I am either ugly or a whore from my parents point of view. The ugly daughter is quiet and moral, useful as an extension of self, as a supportive limb. The daughter-whore is disobedient and shameful, but potentially also an ambitious and serviceable bride if shes clever. Uglyhood and whoredom are unstable states dependent on the moment of observation: one can be both in the course of a day, but one cant be both at the same time.  I developed this theory of my Iranian girl-/daughterhoodgirl and daughter being the same word in Persian,  , an Indo-European cognate to daughterfrom multiple, complex points of view: how I believe my parents view daughters; how Iranian culture, which I know through my parents and my studies of Persian language and literature, views women and daughters; how my mother views herself; how American patriarchy view daughters; how America views Iranians viewing daughters. I like my quantum theory of Iranian girlhood. I try to explain it to my mother at my parents house in San Francisco. I tell her Iranians raise women such that theyre reduced to the level of electron. (I dont mention that she and my father raised me as daughter lest she think Im blaming her for being queer.) My mother stares at me as she has whenever Ive been ill in my life, with pity and blame.   Youre sick, poor thing, she seems to say through the knit between her thin brows. You cant survive without us. Youre totally uncertain of who you are and what the worlds really like. I explain to her the bifurcation of  , ugly, and  , whore.  She laughs. She likes it. Women see themselves how men see them, my mother responds in Persian. Yes! I say in English. The male gaze. Gays? asks my mother. No. I go back into Persian. Some women believe they have less power, because thats how men see them. Some women still unblinkingly assign power to men and thereby validate patriarchy. Not me, she says.  Of course not you. I was womens lib when I was at Berkeley. Why are you talking about this? Youre not a woman, youre a language teacher. I know. Im trying to talk about the situation in Iran now: about the women who are fighting back and insisting they have a choice. It takes so much. Yes. Because we were taught that were less. My mother uses a different word for less from classical Persian that Ive heard no other Iranian ever use in speech:  . The opposite of  , superior, the first syllable of which is cognate to the first syllable in the words major, magnificent, maharaja.  But men, my mother continues, dont have the   of women.   also strikes me as a funny word. A loan word from Arabic, it means gallantry or noble-mindedness. My dictionary translates it as moral heroism.  You speak so royally on this subject, I tell my mother in Persian with a smile. Shes bored of this conversation. Well, I   a princess. Your father is the physicist. Go talk to him, she says as she flicks a piece of lint off her shoulder and walks away. Shes right: my father is the physicist, Im the language instructor (though I prefer interpreter), and she is a liberated woman in that she was raised as a son/daughter hybrid by an absent, much older father and a furious teenage mother who saw womanhood as the source of all anguish. My mother is also a princess, although, at seventy-seven, she works as an optometrist in Menlo Park, California. Many California Persians claim Iranian royalty, but I have proof of my mothers exceptionality. Her family tree arrived to me from Iran as a scroll in calligraphic paleography. It starts with two competing roots, not so unlike the two competing theories of general relativity and quantum theory that explain the universes existence: the ancient, mythological Persian root, which starts with the male-imaged human protoplast Kiumars, and the Islamic one, which starts with Adam and Eve. Then for Pahlavi dynasty loyalists and the authorities of the current Islamic Republic, my mother possesses a legitimate and lofty position: an inheritor of primeval Iranian kingship on the one hand, and a direct descendent of the Prophet Mohammad on the other, and, farther down the Islamic line, a descendent of the Safavid Shah Ismail, the founder of the dynasty that united Iran in the sixteenth century from an inchoate patchwork of chiefdoms and made Shia Islam the state religion. Anyone with a stake in Irans leadership will open the Schrdinger box with my mother in it and find a hero wearing some sort of magical crown or veil. One theory behind the uncertainty of quantum mechanics, the inability to predict accurately whether the cat is dead or alive, whether an electron will pass through the upper slit or the lower slit, is that a bodys identity is defined wholly by its relationship to another body. Everything, all reality, is a reflection of bodies. There can be no box containing a cat and a lethal agent without the cat and the lethal agent; the box is a reflection of its relationship to the cat and the agent. Reality is a set of mirrors.  The  , as a mirror for princes was called in Latin, was a genre of courtly literature intended to provoke self-examination. There are many mirrors for princes in classical Persian, the most famous in the West being Nezm al-Molks   ( ) from the twelfth century. (Ben Kingsley played Nezm al-Molk in the 2010 film  .) The Persian mirrors for princesunlike European ones, such as Machiavellis  stress that the rulerin our case, the shah must be an exemplar of justice. If he isnt, then revolution is in order. I revolted in my own ways. Maybe some will see themselves in me. As the child of a physicist and a liberated optometrist princess, Id like to hold up a mirror for sons who were raised imprecisely as another sex insofar as their parents, deliberately or unintentionally, refined them   that sex. And for daughters who were told they were both ugly and whorish. A description of what its like. A confirmation of reality.  My mirror is not an example of how to revolt, because I havent succeeded at that: I am writing these words in my parents house in San Francisco. Taravat Talepasand,  , 2018  Egg tempera and collage on linen, 22 x 15 inches It may be helpful for me to note that my earliest memory of growing up in San Francisco is being a piss-angry boy mouse. In my phallic phase, when I was three or four and our house was at capacity with refugee guests, one afternoon I ambushed my mother in the hallway and flashed her. I pulled my trousers and underpants down and gripped my difference. My penis felt cold and sandy against the thumb and forefinger. The ascending smell, however, was decidedly adult: salt, feces, hair grease, scents I knew from playing dog, when Id run my nose along the thick worsted ridges of the beige refugee sofa.  I was scared, but the flash felt urgent. I had to do it. I wanted approval and acknowledgment of me and my difference, and I wanted ownership of it. My mother called me  , ugly, and immediately pushed me into the one room I never went in, my fathers office, a cold room awash with the odor of mothballs and Double Mint chewing gum. I then urinated into my fathers brown plastic wastepaper bin.  Am I the only boy in the world who was taught to pee sitting down? My mother told me thats what gentle men (daughters?) are supposed to do in private homes where there are no urinals. That way, you dont spray, and the toilet seat is never up when youre done. It still seems civilized to me. At three or four, however, I wanted her to know I was capable of standing and peeing at home and that I could do so in a little wastepaper basket. I had seen the hefty, bushy pike beneath her belly button; I had seen my fathers hangdog manhood. I had neither and I wanted recognition. I wasnt Mother nor Father, but something  .  I lovedand still lovethe word small. I loved it even more once I could read, as its appearance suggests its meaning: the  - gets overwhelmed by the twin towered ls. My parents cant pronounce it because Persian lacks initial consonant clusters. It comes out as  , which stands bigger than any native English pronunciation. In two syllables, the  - of the boy I saw myself to be as didnt feel protected by the two ls my parents represented. My nickname at home was Mouse,  , which is one syllable but feels mute and vulnerable. Small, Id outgrow. A mouse, my mother would trap and catch and hide inside herself.   When my mother found the urine, bubbly like backwash, I feared shed make me drink it. She called me sick,  , and dirty,  , and she sent me to the bath. Disease is always an Iranian girls fault. When I say I have a little cold, the reply is always Why? What did you do [wrong]?  I continued to piss into that brown plastic bin until my parents decided to replace it with a brand-new bin I was allowed to pick out and, they hoped, keep free of befoulment. The new trash bin would still stay pushed up against the side of my fathers steel desk, like the old one, but it would be mine.  I chose a taller, metal bin that looked exactly like a Pepsi can. At the stationery store not far from my mothers optical shop, on a shelf above the cashier counter, there was a row of tin garbage bins that looked like real soft drink cans. These cans had long mesmerized me, especially the Pepsi one. The red-and-white-and-blue Pepsi logo circle of the 70s and 80s was my first tangible friend, my personal tricolor, my supernational totem watching over me all over San Francisco. It was on the signage of every corner store and deli. Pepsi-Cola was also the first American soft drink to reach Iran. (Coca-Cola apparently conceded both San Francisco   Iran to Pepsi in the Cola Wars.)  I loved hearing the story of my mother and uncle tasting Pepsi for the first time in Esfahan and convincing themselves they were drunk, and my mother loved telling it. Pepsi didnt belong to Americans or Iranians, boys or girls.  The Pepsi bin was expensive, as I was told repeatedly, but I admit it was a bit of clever parenting, because I was then fully potty-trained. I never pissed in the Pepsi bin, but I also never pissed at home standing up. It was that early, when I was three or four, when my mother wrote me off as an expendable girl. I wasnt completely written off as useless, because I still had a job to do: not mousing, but being her mirrorthe small, dark imago of her abhorrence at her own body.  She disburdened her maternal duties to a rubbish bin that looked like a Pepsi can, and she noticed me only when I could serve as an extension of her fear, her hate, or the ugly ambidexterity of her late Pahlavi-era womanhood. Then she could breathe deeply at last, without the noxious scent of boy crotch and urine. Then she could go after her career and the business of her own serious liberation from her mother and father, for whom my own father often stood. Then she could be all the male and all the female energy in the house at the same time.  The Iranians of my youth were obsessed with bodily functions: fluids, sprouts, exuviations. My mother knew which Iranian friends daughters had had their first periods, which child had scabies, which suffered from dandruff. The other mothers knew the same about me. My mothers friend Nilufar once asked my mother within earshot of me: Dannys voice hasnt changed yet, but hes started to grow hair down there, right?  To say nothing of our disproportionate number of sweat glands. We sweat a lot, and were not ashamed of it. You may also hear that we dont believe in deodorant. I wasnt allowed to wear deodorant because it would give my mother and me breast cancer. When I finally snuck some in, when I was in the ninth grade, it was Tickle, a pink brand for ladies that looked like shampoo or body wash. Until very recently, I used to think one reason Iranian women cover themselves so much isnt because theyre excessively prone to sin, but because theyre afraid of having their persons leaving sweaty smudges behind.  Iranian women want absence to feel total, a vacancy, so that others can say what we all want to hear: Your place is empty. Taravat Talepasand,  , 2018  Egg tempera and collage on linen, 22 x 15 inches Iranian boys are fearless in their bodies, as I was when I peed in the trash bin. Their mothers clean and worship them; their fathers teach them to be sexual. They go into the world cheeky.  . Full-faced. They totter into the kitchen and say,  . Mommy, Im hungry. And Mommy prepares them a plate. We girls are not nicethats a Western ideabut we have nice things. Girls are called pretty as children, even when were ugly, and of course were told to be good. (Most of) our fathers help with arithmetic, play soccer with us in dress shoes, and, on the odd occasion, draw us pictures. These pictures are unsettling. My father drew stick drawings of boys pissing off rooftopsanother reason, perhaps, why peeing standing up feels naughty while seated control over it feels so powerful. In the drawings, the boys penises were n-dashes, and the stream of urine was marked by longer m-dashes.  By nine, we are repellent to our fathers. Our fathers give up. They no longer enter their daughters bedrooms, lest they spot a penny of blood on the bedclothes or glimpse apish hair pulling itself down our shins towards our ankles.  My father never played Iranian football with me in his dress shoes. Instead, he walked me, his catamite bride, down the San Francisco Peninsula to my piano instructor, from whose sexual abuse blood did stain my flowered, periwinkle Laura Ashley sheets. I didnt have my own room until I was ten, just about the age we start to repel our fathers. Instead, I slept in one of the two walk-in closets in my parents bedroom. Literally in a closet. A quarter of my junior mattress jutted out, but there was enough of a margin on one side to fit my Fisher Price record player and a bookshelf made of two cinder blocks and plywood. When I got my own room, my father and his friend Parviz put up the wallpaper. It was a pattern of red stars against a white background, and it featured a single band of repeating rainbows, high up, about five inches below the ceiling. Whats odd is that my father picked out that wallpaper pattern. He never entered my room once I got it, though; some primigenial abandonment instinct impelled him to his frigid study at nights, where, because it was mighty or penile, the Pepsi bin was still reserved for me and my scrap paper, and I had to knock before entering. To our mothers, we daughters arent pretty enough. We dont work hard enough. When our mothers think about us, it is in fear that well get pregnant,   (from the Old Persian  , holding the body of the son)with a baby or, in my case, with AIDS. We are their half-ugly, half whores, depending on when they observe us. We are half a person. So were anxious and half-faced,  , a slightly harder word requiring a half-inhale that comes out a sigh. When we are not acting, when we are inside, we are all anxiety and despair. In public, outside, our uncovered half-face is unreachable because were scared. Were scared of how people perceive us. Scared of losing whatever control we have. Let us not forget that were also meant to marry and to hold the bodies of many sons and as many expendable, half-formed daughters as it takes to make our mothers proud of our son production. My parents love to tell me that whenever a girl is born in Iran, the meddlesome aunties and grannies cluck,  : Hopefully, the next one will be a boy.  It will be rape, not sex, that creates these children. We must be scared of that, too. Sex cannot be enjoyed in full marriage, as its only for the production of children. (A man can have unlimited temporary marriages and enjoy sex that way.) My great-grandmother, who married at nine, couldnt have enjoyed it. Both of my grandmothers, one married at thirteen, the other at sixteen (already an old maid, married off to a widower forty years her senior) certainly didnt enjoy sex. Conquest of our husbands and daughters souls is our return for the conquest of our mothers and grandmothers, for the conquest of our own deforming bodies, which we have to present outside, somehow, again tomorrow. We forget that we have already been seen.  Persian lacks the word already. Its meaning is inherent to the present perfect and past perfect tenses. (Even in English theres no significant difference between I have already eaten and I have eaten.) Every time my mother observes me, it is the first time she has ever observed me, which is why I can be both ugly and a whore in the course of a single day. Everything Ive ever done, Ive ever said or looked like is forgotten. She never   knows me. For Iranian girls, because already does not exist, its forever the unquiet night before the first day of school.  Let that, therefore, be   as I experienced it: there is no unified theory of matter. You change as youre observed. Your matteryour admixture of hair, teeth, skin, organsis nothing whole, nothing free, nothing to be cherished by anybody. Many decades passed before I figured out the principles of conduct to which my parents would like me to adhere. I still fail. In their house, I am the only one who gets hurt. That is because my disturbance, my hurt, is necessary for the consistency of their viewpoint. Let that be  : as the daughter struggles both to appease and to reject her parents, only   energy is wasted; all progress for the child increases entropy for her and only for her within the family system.  I do not know who my parents disturbed before I came along. For a time, it was the feds, but thats another essay.  I was never in want for anything, but I was expected to be prepared. My mother modeled for me the duality that Iranian girls are meant to mimic and Iranian boys are meant to respect: be the lion at home but the hind at large. Care nothing, know nothing, about who your child is, girl or boy, or what your husband does for a living. If there turns out to be a gap between your views and your husbands or, later, your sons, then pay it no mind and maintain that lack of curiosity. If there is so much as a perceptible slit between your views and your daughters, tell her, remind her, that she is a negation. Let that be  : an Iranian girl has the same mass but opposite charge of an Iranian boy. Iranian girls like me are not expected to succeed through displays of public mastery: advanced degrees and high-paying jobs and fame.  .  . We succeed through cunning. We distrust male guardianship. For a long time, we didnt wish to abandon male guardianship for some universal sisterhood or, worse, independence, but things at last are changing. This may sound Eastern, but our Iranian iteration of sonhood and daughterhood comes from Western Civ, with only a touch of the acidulation that characterizes our food. This is very old wisdom, more ancient than the tiger mother scheme, which was a cynical capitalization of American racism. Persians appear in ancient Greek literature as well as in the Hebrew Bible; contemporary Iranians have culled wisdom from both sources and mixed it with our own. For example, the psalms enjoin us to place our trust in neither princes nor menwomen are wholly excludedbut the Lord, the paternal godhead. In Avestan, the Old Persian language of sacred Zoroastrian texts which, unlike New Persian, is highly gendered,  , a feminine noun signifying deceit, falsehood, is the antonym to the neuter noun  , the highest virtue: truth. Truth is a neutered vision of the world, essentially unstable, for its neither male nor female. Lies and deceit are female business. The New Persian word for lie is  , from  . Both words are cognate to the Icelandic  , ghost, the German trgen, to deceive, and the English dream. Women must lie, my mother taught me, in order to be perceived, to be felt. Like Scheherazade, they have to fabricate stories in order to survive. Taravat Talepasand,  , 2018  Egg tempera and collage on linen, 22 x 15 inches Im an Iranian girl! is what Zahra, half Iranian/half Iraqi, fully whorish, though we didnt know this then, exclaimed on Halloween when we were six or seven. We made fun of her of that. She must have been wearing some sort of national costume, but were a nation of nations, with, famouslyAmericans love this! a king of  , so was she dressed as a Kurd? In a turquoise vest? Or as a Baloch, with those ruched, vermillion sleeves? In a Gulf costume, something a young bride might wear, milky, like the mouth of the Tigris? Then in sixth grade, when we were sitting on the floor at Halehs house, eating dinner on a king-sized bedsheet, because our parents made us eat on the floor like in the old country, Zahra said, Azar went to I-ran. As if she were talking about yesterdays jog: I ran. Like the 80s pop song by A Flock of Seagulls. All of us, the girls and the boys, in sincere outrage, stopped chewing in shock at Zahras pronunciation. We dont betray each other, not like that. In plain sight, Zahra brazenly revealed herself to be a treasonous whore. We pronounce Iran correctly because we are as proud as we are virtuous.  Maybe because we made fun of her and thereby betrayed her in return, or maybe because she was only half Iranian, Zahra ran away. She and her mother hardly speak. My mother reminds me of this whenever we gossip, which is every time I talk to my mother. My mother pities her   my heart chafesbecause Zahra failed to be half-faced, but I adore Zahra. I think shes a receptionist at a big corporation in San Jose, California, the first person you meet when you walk through the double doors. Shes already there.  Are you boy or girl? a waitress asked of me when I was thirteen, at a 1950s rock-around-the-clock diner turned Chinese restaurant, while I ate sweet and sour chicken with my best Iranian girlfriend Marjan. Marjan, whore, laughed. She was delighted. I pulled down the rim of my Janet Jackson Rhythm Nation 1814 baseball cap and pouted. I insisted we leave a penny tip.  All of us, Iranian boys and girls, are imperial. A nation of nations, with a king over kings, we conquer, undemocratically. At parties, we dance solo surrounded by other girls, and later, on the pavement when we walk alone to our cars, we pound our boot heels hard. We only dance with girls at parties; we dont look up as we walk down the street. We are nervous around men until, in private, we conquer them. Then were brutal.  Thats what I do. Are other Eastern, non-Iranian boys are raised as girls, as their mothers mirrors? Do they pass as girls?  Have I ever passed as a man? Dude, are you a she-male? a pizza delivery employee asked me once over the phone while I was in college. Today I get yes, maam on the phone less, but sometimes when Im nervous, my voice will toot high above its regular strangled sound. Its not a womans voice. Its the growl of a child, a girl, lodged in my throat. Iranians have no sense of time. Thats why were always late, yes, but thats also how we conquer: slowly (though loudly). Again, look at Scheherazade. She was pure whore; her name is the Arabicization of  , literally born of beautiful face. But she was clever. She told stories. She conquered time. She manipulated the sultan totally, and she was never caught, never killed.  Looking in the mirror, we are not beautiful.  My mother often says that I inherited her hair, which is  : like a goats vagina. My mother is an expert on caprine gynecology. When I was fourteen or so, she told me that shes seen my   get hard,  , contumacious, through my trousers, and if I ever found I couldnt control it, I should fuck a goat. Not a sheep (they buck) or a pig (they squeal), but a great nanny goat.  A Persians heaven is easily made, wrote Thomas Moore. (Moore the raffish Irish poet, not More the venerated author of  .) Tis but black eyes and lemonade. Strangely, my eyes are darker than both my parents: oil-black, no telling the pupils from the irises. They are two night-mirrors. In Scheherazades time, a wife or concubines boudoir was called  , with the famous  suffix, as in Afghanistan or Pakistan: the land of night.  We are colorists and hairists, and if I could not, cannot, pass as a boy, I can (despite my eyes) pass as white. Thats luck, according to Mother. Zahra has never passed. Marjan has, but she has the distinctive carriage of an Iranian whore: urgent, marred, funerary a pretty dress spread on a chain-link fence at a tag sale. You can tell shes not Italian, as she wishes she were. Actually, she is now that shes married to an Italian, a man she conquered in fine whorish form, first by first stalking him then by making herself indispensable to him. You dont look Iranian, Iranians and non-Iranians alike say to me as compliments.  I shrug. Taravat Talepasand,  , 2018  Egg tempera and collage on linen, 22 x 15 inches Of course there are many, many accomplished Iranian women. My great-grandmother, the nine-year-old bride, is one. She was trained to give sanitary abortions by her physician husband, and she continued to provide them even after the authorities were notified. (Abortion was legal in Iran for a small window in the 1970s.)  To return to quantum theory: it emerged by rejecting classical science, rejecting the rational, the old, eventually obvious first principles of Newtonian mechanics. Let us make  : there are many extraordinary Iranian women who arent unstable, who arent quarks, who are more than ugly, more than whorish, more than a dental or pharmaceutical or law degree. An Iranian woman went into space, defying general relativity. Every woman whos risked and lost her life in Iran since September 16, 2022 is extraordinary.  My father often says the genius behind cola drinks, behind Pepsi, is that anywhere you go in the world, you know what it will taste like. In one of those universes, there is my perfect cognate, and I dont disappoint. In one of those universes, there arent two superpositioned selves, there arent parent observers who assert ownership over my tired body, but two people who know how to see, how to speak. In one of those universes, I am the same everywhere and always. Free from observation, free from mirrors, free from princes.Of that I think am certain.

The roads erupted with traffic on sunny weekends. Hotels that blocked too many peoples views were burned to the ground. The harbor hadnt been dredged in so long the water was dirtier than anywhere else for miles. Beyond the safety of the groin a circle of surfers sat, bodies lifting and falling with the water. Scattered flower petals popped red, orange, and pink against the waters reflection of the cool gray sky overhead. Safely past the place where the ocean floor rose to become land and pushed the water into waves, they reached out and held hands. Sam left us much too early. Lived a full, full life. He was always kind, always there to lend a hand. Always halfway to the beach. His mother, Rebecca sat in the back of a double kayak. She was not the water creature her son had been, and his surf coach, Mark, had paddled her out to be part of the ceremony. At her slightest shifts in weight the boat tipped toward the surface of the dark cold water. The heads of Sams friends and acquaintances were stuffed into black wetsuit hoods and damp strands of hair poked out around their faces. Rebecca tried to fix them into her memory and hold on, knowing that all too soon shed be back on the firm and unyielding land. People came to the house in pairs mostly, and the refrigerator filled with meals in glass dishes Rebecca could reheat. She got flowers with notes written in the looping handwriting of the only florist in town. Nurses that Rebecca had worked with at the hospital sent big cards with swans that floated against impressionistic garden scenes. Sams third-grade teacher dropped off  , the kind of book that as a child he had been able to sit through because it had few enough words. Sams dads brother, who Rebecca hadnt seen in years, called and offered stiff condolences. At the dry land funeral her aunt sputtered about how the loss of a child was the worst thing that could happen to a person until Rebeccas cousin grabbed her, stopping just short of clamping a hand over her mothers mouth. For weeks Rebecca kept the cards standing upright on the kitchen table in a small paper city of good thoughts. When she drank coffee in the morning she stared with tunnel vision at the flowers and avoided looking anywhere else. In the grocery store she drew a tub of yogurt out of the refrigerator and the extra weight threatened to tip her over. When she shut the glass door a woman in a yellow sweater was there on the other side. The woman said her son had gone to middle school with Sam and there was something in her sad gaze and the solid plant of her feet that gave Rebecca the impression that the woman was poised to catch her.   Im doing okay, Rebecca said. She hadnt heard the question and hoped that it was the right shaped answer. The womans name would not come to her so she smiled. At the meat counter, Margarita stood, wrapping chicken breast and pink steaks in thick white paper. She had been there since Sam had been a wriggling toddler in the cart. Margarita wiped the red juices from her hands on a towel and walked around to the other side of the counter to put her arms around Rebecca. It was a feat to get up out of bed where the covers and dregs of sleep sheltered her from the recurring process of recalling with a renewed ache that he was gone. Getting dressed and going outside into a world that misted memories of Sam was like lifting iron off her chest every day. Some weeks she grocery shopped in the next town over and cried in the car. One morning when Rebecca stepped outside to collect the mail there was a pot with an orchid sitting on the ground beside the front door.  A white bloom was open at the top. The rest of the stem was peppered by a smattering of shiny round buds. The attached note was written in an unfamiliar scrawl. There were no instructions attached for caring for the plant. Up until that point the flowers that came were all cut, clearly and without question temporary. Rebecca could bear their slow droop and shedding of petals and pollen because they were already gone. As she eyed this living plant on the ground at her feet she felt angry because she had failed to keep it alive. She took it into the backyard and ripped the bloom off and threw it down but it landed so softly she felt nothing. Raising the plant over her head, she threw the whole thing down. The smooth brown terra cotta pot shattered and the orchid lay there with its gray tentacle roots akimbo in the debris of bark and dirt. She looked down, thought about reaching for the turquoise garden hose and really going in on it. Someone cleared their throat. Her neighbor was standing there, tall enough to poke his face over the fence. 'I heard a crash so I thought Id investigate. Everything okay? His swirl of white hair fluffed up above his head. Yes, Im fine.  Well, while Im here, I just wanted to let you know that Dana gets tired of cooking just for me. Youre welcome to join us for dinner anytime. Thank you, that would be lovely. And, he dropped his voice, please know that its absolutely fine for you to cry. He gave the fence a hearty pat and was gone. She thought of Sams father and how tall hed looked the first time she saw him standing on the dock beside his boat, his body long and lean, apt for swimming. It was where Sams fishlike tendencies had come from. Rebecca picked up the orchid, now just a stem and roots, and threw it in the trash in the kitchen. But that evening as she sipped potato leek soup, drank a bottle of wine, and futzed over a puzzle she kept thinking of it there, shriveling slowly, deprived of air in the dark plastic bag. Aline Mare,  , 2021  Unique photo-based process on archival paper with paint, 24 x 30 in The flower shop was at the end of Arroyo Road, the main drag in town, in an old wooden barn that over the years had weathered shiny gray. Pots of flowers, herbs, and vines sat in neat rows out front. Trickles of water ran out from their bottoms and Rebecca could see a figure further back in the yard with a hose. She stepped through the door into an immaculately ordered room. Green cabinets lined the walls and in the center beneath a dangling light was a table covered in dahlias, tuberoses, mums, roses, stock, gerber daisies, calla lilies, stargazer lilies, tulips, and scabiosa. The florists hair was wrapped in a bun and gloves covered her hands. She cut through the thick stems of eucalyptus branches. The medicinal scent of the plant's sap filled the room and fragments of the stems ricocheted off her white apron. 'How can I help you? I found this in the parking lot, Rebecca said brightly. She held up the mangled orchid. Here? The florist frowned and took it from her. Rebecca tried to appear nonchalant as she looked around the room. Ribbons for all occasions lined the shelf behind the florist. Do you do a lot of funerals? she asked, pulling at one of the bright pink ribbons. It unrolled into her hands. Yes. And birthdays, proms, Mothers Day, graduations. The florist poured a handful of bark into a pot and tucked the orchid into it gently. She handed it back to Rebecca. Soak the roots once a week, cut the stem to the base when it stops blooming. There was a mobile dangling in the back door window, refracting bits of light onto the wall. The door opened and another employee walked in, her apron slightly less clean than her counterparts. The bride called and she wants to move the delivery up two hours. Rebecca reached down into her purse but the florist waved her off.  Dont worry about it. The two of them launched into stuffing boxes, throwing vases around with small amounts of water, slowing down only to pick up the bouquets themselves. Just outside the door Rebecca paused. A pot like the one shed shattered was there, stacked on top of other colors of the same shape. She was crouched down and had reached for one when she heard her name float out the door above the din. That was Rebecca. She one of our regulars? The one whose son drowned. Ohhhh. Nicks cousin surfs and he told me that Sam was high when it happened. Rebecca left quickly, and drove without a destination in mind. The midafternoon traffic was quiet enough that she ran lights without consequence. It made little difference relative to the banging thoughts hammering at the inside of her head. The road dropped down to eye level with the curve of the coastline and she pulled over and watched the surfers that dotted the water. As a wave swelled a surfer started to paddle, frantically, faster and faster as the wave grew up behind their small form. They caught it but just as they went to stand the tip of the board dipped forward and they were pitched forward into the water where they disappeared beneath the surface. Over the years of report cards, detention slips, and calls from teachers, Rebecca had learned that many times when she thought he was in one place, Sam had been in the water. None of the consequences that arose had mattered to him in the face of even the mere rumor of a good wave. Wondering if that was him out in the cold, powerful waves had been like breathing, and it was a habit she didnt want to let go of. She climbed over the boulders that separated the road from the sand and walked slowly to the edge. The cool air washed over her skin. A couple of surfers swam in and now walked, boards tucked beneath their arms, in her direction. From where she stood they could have been anybody, just bodies dripping and clad in black rubbery suits. One broke off and started to walk straight towards her. Her heart pumped harder. His gait, the long steps, and the way the foot lifted and fell, seemed familiar. She hoped, then believed, that it was her son, walking toward her to come say, with his goofy smile, that it had all been a surreal and terrible dream. The figure got closer and his face came into focus. Mark, she croaked. Hey there! Thinking about going for a swim? It wouldnt be too cold for you in a 4 ml. suit I bet. He pulled the hood, stretching it so that it snapped back before his head was free. A couple drops of water landed on Rebeccas shoulder.  She looked out toward the horizon. When you took me out for the funeral, it was my first time on the water in years. I forgot how powerful it feels. She shivered. Thats the beauty right there. He paused and looked at her. His skin was weathered, tanned and etched with lines from years in the sun.  You got it! Come on, just push past that last set of breakers. Mark stood on the beach yelling. The wetsuit was so tight it pulled on Rebeccas chest and shoulders and squeezed her calves. The hood pressed in on her ears and turning her neck from one side to the other was difficult. When she first stepped into the water all she could feel was the movement around her feet outside of the boots. But then icy fingers crept into the boots and her feet screamed in pain. Another step and the cold wrapped around her knees, all the way to the bone. When a wave pushed past her and her vagina, belly button, and butt were submerged, she felt the urge again to get out. But when she finally got deep enough for the water to come in through the thick zipper that ran down her back there was no turning back. Her breath was gone and she gulped tiny mouthfuls of air. Everything clenched tight and she turned and looked back at Mark, eyes wild. He waved his thick arm and a wave caught Rebecca from behind and knocked her over. It tossed her like a rag in a washing machine and she tried to come up but wasnt sure which way that was and when she finally did break the surface again she gasped, and her mouth and nose were assaulted by the burning salt water. She dragged her feet through the water and went into the beach. Do not ever turn your back to the ocean, Mark told her. She nodded, shivering. Aline Mare,   , 2021  Unique photo-based process on archival paper with paint, 32 x 46 in At the neighbors for dinner they asked if anything had been helping in particular lately. Swimming, she told them. Oh yeah? Up at the gym in town? Dana asked, passing her a napkin. No, in the ocean. Rebecca gnawed on the bone. Martin looked at Dana. By yourself? I know, my friends hate that I go alone. But I dont go very far out. They knew somehow that there was no point in telling her to be careful. The shock of the cold waters icy slap never lessened, no matter how many times Rebecca walked into the sea. The currents that traveled down from Canada penetrated her whole body, sending every sense into high alert. Her skin pulled taut and rose in goosebumps. Her heart pounded hot blood out to her fingers and toes. The first time she submerged her head she usually felt like she might throw up and she waited for it to pass while her eyes instinctively tried to make sense of the shadows and streaks of light that cut through the murky water.  Shadows coalesced into points and shed have a flicker of certainty that she was looking at the head of a creature there, just in front of her. Slowly as she started to move through the water the shapes would disappear. Her body traced a line parallel to the coastline and a rhythm took over. With every other breath shed lift her head up and see the sand, which gave way to low cliffs carpeted in spiky succulents. When she turned to breathe in the other direction there was only more ocean, stretching on and on until the flat line of the horizon. Her thoughts swirled like the water. No one was there trying to figure out the right thing to say and so in return she didnt have to try to say the right thing back. There were questions of her own. How was it that a dead whale could wash ashore, stink up the whole place with its body and had to be dragged out 25 miles offshore so that it wouldnt float back, when Sams body had disappeared without a trace? What could I have done to help you? I should have done more.  At every turn of their lives together there were notches, paths taken and not taken. If your dad had been around?  Sam had told her in 7th grade one day after his science class, that the clear turquoise waters off tropical islands had less nutrients. Hed pointed out the car window and said, Look, our water is darker. It has more life. Each week Rebecca swam a little farther. After a month she could swim all the way to a large green buoy. It bobbed in the waves, the water level rising up to the base where the green tower emerged, then lowering to expose the rusted section and then in the next instant rising and submerging it once more. Sometimes a seal would be there, its speckled bulbous body hauled up onto the rusty green edge. Itd hop off as she approached, sending a spike of fear through her, and shed reach out and touch the rough metal with her hands. Then, stroke by stroke, she would make her way back to the stretch of beach where she left her shoes and small mountain of clothes. By the time she got back the sun would be up, the fog that covered the sky most mornings thick overhead.  She began to crave the quiet that came over her when she swam. The fullness of the ocean around her where sound was neither absent nor present. When she swam she could move with some of the grief. The cold made her alert, present and alive to her body. There were no looks in peoples eyes like she might be a broken toy that would never truly run again. Sometimes she would remember the mornings, her with tea, Sam with a bowl of cereal turning soggy as he swirled the milk with his spoon. The peace of that simple ritual. A memory she could have drifted off into had the relentless ocean not called her back, consistent in its wildness and making no exceptions, not even for her. Rebecca met Mark for a beer at the bar. Candles flickered against the shiny dark wood walls and the bartender was friendly. Are you ever afraid? she asked him. I mean, sure. Its important to have a healthy dose of fear for ol mother nature. You afraid of something in particular? It mostly happens in the beginning, Rebecca took a sip. Ill see things, shapes. My imagination goes wild. Mark nodded. Have you ever seen a shark? she asked. Yep. Was it a fin, like the movies? You know, it wasnt. What gave it away was the water. The way that it moved. It was too deep to show its fin, but something that big, well, displaces a lot of water, and you can see that in the vibrations on the surface. Like its boiling. But you were sure thats what it was? He raised his eyebrows and finished his beer. Only one thing makes the water move that way. Why did I ask? Rebecca shook her head. They are out there. He moved his hand from the empty bottle and laid it on hers.         Aline Mare,  , 2022  Unique photo-based process on archival paper with paint, 24 x 30 in Marks house was small, just a living room with a couch that pulled out into a bed, and a kitchenette with just a stove and no oven. It was an easy and lonely place. He placed his hand on Rebeccas bare chest, rubbed smooth circles all over her, patient and slow. He watched her face. She blushed. It had been a while, she wasnt sure which way to go. She put her hands around his arms, felt the soft skin on his wrists. Kissed there. He kissed her mouth and she ran her hands through his hair. The ocean, he had told her, was the one love hed never lost. The salt water had made his hair coarse. It curled between her fingers. They tensed, breathed deeper, faster, then slower, pulled at each other, asked questions, answered, and eventually a rhythm emerged, potential energy let loose unwinding into kinetic, free to drop, to fall, to spread. And then break. Break. Rebecca covered her face, willing it not to happen, but the tears came and then she just tried not to make it ugly. There was no way to be only selectively undone. Mark was panting as he tried gently to pry her arms away from her face. When he couldnt he sat up and wiped himself, then her. She regained some control when he stood, and finally stepped away, his warmth removed so that the cool night could take over. Bits of streetlight from outside reflected off his skin. When she took the box of tissues that he handed her they both felt something shift in the room, like a dead bolt falling into place. I loved him, too, he told her. Nothing like you, I know that, but in my way I really miss him. And he could be a real shit sometimes. He wiped his eyes, Got so drunk on one of our trips south that he swung at me. Mark laughed, leaning back against the pillows. Rebecca remembered Sam coming back with a black eye from one of the surf trips. Hed said his board had hit him. In the morning she drove to the diner for fried eggs just as a faint blue light was filling the sky. It was pretty empty, still too early for the flocks of weekend tourists. Her order came, a plate laden with hash browns, fruit, eggs, and toast. There was something familiar about the man cooking. The faint line of a tattoo curled from behind his ear and down his neck. She leaned over the counter, ignoring the confused eyes the man who had served her was making. Excuse me, did you go to San Pedro Elementary School? Yes. He flipped a pancake.  Did you know my son, Sam? He stepped back from the grill a moment. Eggs, sausages, peppers, and bread spread out around him. Rebecca, its me, Ivan. Yani was my mom. Of course we knew Sam. His adult features yielded to her memory of him as a child then, running around his moms daycare where Sam had gone. Oy! Cuidalo. He motioned for one of the other guys in the kitchen to look after the grill and walked up to the counter. How is Yani? Ah, she died a few years back. Ovarian cancer. He pursed his lips, his eyes suddenly glassy. After a certain age, Sam and Ivans lives had been channeled onto different paths. Subtle dotted lines that carved apart where they shopped for groceries, lived, and mourned their dead. There had been nothing in the newspaper that Rebecca read each week about Yanis passing.  We lit candles at Saint Josephs for Sam, Ivan said. Stronger smells were starting to fill the air. Theyre burning my dishes back there, he said, Its good to see you. Rebecca finished her meal and left a 50% tip. That day the water was choppy and rougher than usual. She hesitated before she got in, thought about her friends warnings. The suggestions to find a group to go with. As she swam she felt tired. As she approached the buoy, lifting her face out of the water to breathe, she saw a seal. She got closer but it didnt move other than to lift its head and tail up, curving its body into the shape of a wide U. Rebecca didnt touch the rusty flakes and kept going. Her arms were heavy, but she kicked down into the darkness. Her ears popped, the goggles pressed into the skin around her eyes and her lungs wanted air. Her hand collided with the sandy bottom and she exhaled, bubbles racing off towards the surface. Her body sank, shed gone deep enough for the air in the suit to compress. There was not much buoyancy to her. It was so relieving to be dark and cold, like being inside of an iceberg. But she looked up because a glimmer of light made it down much deeper than she could. And there in that liminal space where light and dark constantly exchanged from one moment to the next, she thought she saw it. The ancient contour, the form of a shark, chiseled in time. And a foreground and background emerged. Rebecca was up to the surface so fast and when she saw the pale sand and scrubby hills in the distance panic took over and a scream rose up in her and then out and it was mangled by the water and then that water was in her mouth, in her lungs and she was coughing, sputtering, hauling, stroke after stroke toward the shore. The force of the tide pulled her back and then pushed her forward and every second was the infinite one that would be her last before the animals teeth closed around her arm, her leg, just to taste before realizing there was nothing to her. She crawled out onto the wet foamy sand and rolled onto her back. Rough green boughs of a cypress tree came into focus. Rebecca reached back for the thin black cord tied to the wetsuit zipper. She yanked it open and ripped the neoprene away from her shoulders and sat there, in a red bathing suit crushed up against her body. With her eyes she dug into the cresting waves, waiting for the fin to emerge, while the salt water dripped down her back.  Lena King  is a writer and teacher based in Brooklyn.

        "author": "Michael Guinzburg",
        "text": "Art by Farrell Brickhouse FarrellBrickhouse, , 2021, oil and glitter on canvas, 20 x 16 in Somehow, I ended up in Boston a few years back on a blackout bender, which led to a detox and a halfway house and AA and well you get the picture. I had wrecked my life in New York and now was cleaning it up in Boston. But I liked my job cleaning houses, and I liked the idea of cleaning up my life. Living in a single room, trying to make enough money to get by, maybe get a car in a year. Doing the meetings. As we approached the giant mansion in Brookline that needed a final fluff to make sure all the previous owners crap was out of there, my boss Leon said, Yo, its Tom Bradys house!  I Googled it. Sold. Purchase price: thirty-three million. Built in 2015, about ten thousand square feet, on five emerald acres, with a giant swimming pool, a luxury sundeck, organic vegetable garden, a recreation room you could wreck yourself in, a playroom, a gym, a spa, a wine room big enough for twelve Guatemalan newcomers to play cornhole comfortably, an eat-in chefs kitchen, and a spanking new barn with a yoga studio andanyway, Tom Brady, the master of the castle, was long gone to Tampa with his wife and kids, and the Super Bowl was happening in less than two weeks with Brady and the Buccaneers jousting with the Chiefs. Leon and I scoured the house, polished the floors, dusted the mantelpieces and moldings, vacuumed, picked up all the tiny scraps of this and that, out of each room, fast and efficient as Tom Brady running a two-minute drill. In a kitchen drawer I found three Chinese fortune cookie slips promising me opportunity around the corner, a bright future in a new field, and an admonition to remember that luck is a product of hard-work and a positive attitude. I laughed out loud and pocketed the tiny messages as a souvenir. Luck, thy avatar is Tom Brady. Its normal that I hate the Red Sox and Red Sox fans and the Patriots and Patriot fans and the Patriot Way, and, lets face it, not only did I resent paying a penny of taxes in Massachusetts, and every time I heard a Boston accent it felt like fingernails on a chalkboard, but I hated Tom Brady. Yeah, I was sober, but definitely not happy, or friendly. Other peoples success made me feel so bad about myself I wanted to throw myself in the Charles. I shared about it in AA.  FarrellBrickhouse, , 2018-21, oil on tuna can, beauty by accident So, Im cleaning the garage at the old Brady place and there in a corner I find three medium garbage bags full of old clothes with a tag saying TAKE TO GOODWILL. One of the perks of the job is finders-keepers, if the people have moved out of the state or are dead. But at TB12s I wasnt expecting much. It looked like a lot of kids clothes. But you gotta look carefully, cause you never know. Once, I found a small diamond wedged in a corner of a drawer of a dead womans dresser. I sold it for a grand. I kind of felt bad, you know, not sharing the money with her family, but I gave Leon his five hundred bucks, so, I mean, Im not a saint. Certainly not a Saints fan, though I once dated a girl from New Orleans who made good gumbo and bad voodoo. Anyway, two bags of kids clothes and a bag full of old socks, but good ones, like special Peruvian alpaca socks and good wool and I dunno, lots of big socks. Tom Brady had not only left the building hed left his socks. Like he was done with cold weather for good and Hey, Mike! Lets go! Leon yelled. Quittin time. I grabbed the bags and found my way out to the kitchen where Leon has the freezer open and hes poking in the cold and finds a bottle of Grey Goose. Whatcha got, bro? he asks, plucking the bottle from the fridge. Clothes, say I. You want the kids stuff?  For sure. Leon Morrison was a father to three. He was half-Black and half-Irish. Ill take the socks Hey Leon, dont drink that. Put a sock in it, Mike. He gunned the Goose, made the appropriate noises, danced a Black Irish jig, grunted with satisfaction, and with reddening eyes stuffed the bottle into one of the Brady kids clothes bags and said, Youre driving, honcho. Leon drank some Brady vodka on the way back to town and waxed philosophical about luck. I dropped him off in Somerville, left the van there too, locked behind a fence, and took my bag full of secondhand socks home on the T, thats the train, what the heathens here call a subway. What a loser, I think to myself. What a loser. Some people get Super Bowl rings and supermodel wives and Im left holding a bag full of socks. Tom Bradys old socks. Finders-keepers? How about losers-finders? losers-keepers? losers-weepers? How about all of the above with a side order of self-pity? How about an AA meeting, Papi? I get to the room, make some franks and beans in one pan on the hot plate and eat that while listening to the sports news, the Super Bowl Brady chatter on the radio; then I wash my plate and the pan and drink some cold instant coffee from the morning and shave and get ready to walk to the meeting in the church basement three blocks away. Before leaving, I think about the bag of socks. I empty the bag on the bed. Theyre nice socks. Clean. And whats this, heres a blue beanie with horizontal stripes of red and white with a red pompom and the old Patriot symbol, the guy hiking the ball. Thats kind of cool, I think. Maybe its  Tom Bradys hat? I hate the Patriots. I hate Boston. I hate everything, including myself. Just go to the AA meeting. Then Im staring at the hat and Im getting this feeling like I gotta put it on. I put it on. And this is the Gods honest truth, at that moment, I felt really happy. For the first time in twenty years I felt okay. It was a strange moment because as I said, I hate the Patriots and Brady and all their success and I hate Boston accents and why not go to that AA meeting and share that, yeah. So I go to the meeting, wearing Tom Bradys hat. Its nice and cold out and the hat is great but when I get to the meeting its hot in there and everyone is wearing masks cause of the Covid and Im hearing nothing and thinking only of three things, girls and booze and money.  I bolt out of there after a few minutes into the pure free cold and I end up in a dark dive demolishing rum and Cokes, meeting Lacy, a blonde secretary from Swampscott, who takes me to an after-hours joint where they have gambling, and we play roulette and I win big. I turn a hundred and forty dollars into three thousand five hundred and twenty.  Lacy and I get home by dawn and things work out pretty well for us over the next week. Mike, she says on the third day. Why are you wearing that hat all the time? I dont think Ive ever seen you without it. That is true, Lacy. I love my hat, it makes me happy, its my lucky hat. I can do anything in this hat. I can drink liquor safely, gamble with luck, and wake up and go to work and have a good-looking girlfriend like you who has a better job than me and who is gonna take me for a walk on the beach in Swampscott. Maybe Ill meet your parents some day. Lacy looks at me with horror. I read her mind. Im not taking this old guy to Swampscott. I didnt tell Lacy it was Tom Bradys lucky hat. The one he used to wear in interviews on the podium after special victories. She might take it. Then dump me. Im not stupid. True, Im not young, and Im not particularly good-looking, not in the best shape, not even smart or fun or charming or rich or responsible, any of that good stuff women want, but all of sudden, wearing that hat, those first days, women everywhere started smiling at me. All of them. For the first time in my life, they were making conversation out of the blue, on the train, in the stores, and at first I didnt know what to think, but then I just went with it and chatted them up and got numbers and called and made lunch dates and was still seeing Lacy at night and partying but, wow, what a week! What a hat! A lucky hat! I was drinking and winning, winning with girls and winning moneywearing Bradys hat! I love every single one of you!  FarrellBrickhouse, , from the   series,, 2022, oil on canvas, diptych, 16 x 10 in I bet my roll, five grand, on Brady and the Bucs to win. Guess what? They did, doubling my money. I rubbed my lucky hatour lucky hatand thought, God bless Tom Brady. And this hat. Ill protect this hat through thick and thin and thinner and Life stayed really thick, really good. For Tom Brady and for me. And I wore the hat everywhere. I slept in that hat, made love in that hat. Took the hat off to shower but kept it on the towel rack and put it back on immediately after. Leon and I bought a second van, hired more people, and within a year we had five cleaning trucks specializing in move-outs and dead-people cleanups. We were busy bees and I rocked that hat. Lacy was gone but so what. I was meeting and dating and meeting and dating and happy as a clam who hadnt been thrown in the chowder. As long as I had the hat, life was good. I could take an Uber to Swampscott and walk that beach any day. And then early in 2022 Tom Brady announces his retirement and that week I lose two thousand on the ponies and crash the newest van. I have my first hangover since I started drinking again and even experience one of those troubling erectile moments you hear about other guys having.  And it got worse. The IRS came and seized all the vans and all the equipment because it turns out Leon hadnt paid taxes in fourteen years and I had to move from the new apartment to the room again where life is gloomy and doomy and dark. And yet still I rocked the hat. In for a dime. In for a dollar. FarrellBrickhouse, , from the   series, 2023, oil on canvas, 24 x 20 in A month later, Brady says hes coming back! Hosannah! Hes reversing the retirement, its a mulligan, a do-over, and I think, okay, things are gonna get better. But sorry Papi, for me its all gone wrong, for him too, and by the time football season rolls around and his wife has bolted back to Brazil and the divorce is final, I get arrested for public urination and spend a night in jail and the next week get mugged for my last dollar and my teeth knocked out and my left hand broken and I wake up in a public detox. I hear a nurse standing above me. He wont let anyone take his hat. Take my hat, I said. What? Please, take my hat. Are you sure? No, I said, tears streaming down my face. Dont take it. So I kept the hat and went back to my room.  I didnt have any money so I had to give up the room and the hot plate.  But I kept the hat. I gave up the liquor, the gambling, and even swearing. And the women gave me up, it goes without saying but Ill admit it. I kept the hat. I got a tent, a sleeping bag, I have a lot of great socks. Toms old socks. I panhandle for money. I eat fast food. I wear the hat. I even rooted for the Patriots. Brady and the Bucs get clobbered in the playoffs. They sucked. But I was eating every day and sober and even though I was sleeping rough on the streets, in a tent, I was alive, right? So I kept the hat, and I wear the hat, because, heck, I believe in Tom Brady. I believe in second chances.  He announced his retirement, again, this morning. Its just temporary. Ole Tom needs a rest. Teaching us how to win at life is hard work. And isnt that what Tom has been teaching us, all of us? How to win gracefully, how to lose gracefully, how to be the best we can be, without joining the army or marines? Didnt he teach us magic? To believe in second chances, third chances? In fifth sixth and seventh chances?  That hard work and a positive attitude breeds luck. Where had I heard that before. Belichick? FarrellBrickhouse, , from the FarrellBrickhouse,Star Man, 2023. Oil, collage. Approx. 13x11x11 inches,   series, 2023, oil, collage, approx. 13 x 11 x 11 in I reached into the fob pocket of my jeans and brought out those three little slivers of wisdom, the Chinese fortunes Id found two years ago back in Bradys kitchen, the ones I treasure, promising me opportunity around the corner, a bright future in a new field, and to remember that luck is a product of hard-work and a positive attitude. The Patriot Way. So I get up, put on Bradys hat and socks and I go to work. The Patriot Way. And as the time ticks on and the dimes and the dollars roll into my cup and the people pass me by saying such things as, Love the hat, bro! I say, Dont you worry, Toms just taking the year off. Hell be back. Hell come back. And if he doesnt, well, hes like that character that other Tom, Tom Joad in that book we read in high school. On those cold winter nights in Beantown, Tom Bradys hat keeps me warm. Its doing its job. The Patriot Way. Michael Guinzburg is a native New Yorker living in Los Angeles.

The subjectgiven the limitations of the frame, not to mention the arrival of the lionsmay nevertheless appear to us a cabbage, for instance, or a rabbit, a quite decrepit specimen at that, en route to the stockpot for luncheon, one imagines, a few of its larger bones thrown out to the schnauzers. The mother in a tintype, hidden behind a patterned blanket: her form, its outline, is best remembered as a map, the northern portionfrom which issues a narrow ropeablaze in several places. No doubt the child opens his eyes, presently, to find himself once again in an empty roomstanding at the wrong door, at the wrong hourcaptured in a rueful attitude, his hands obscured by two fragments of glass.  The portrait on the lawn, late in the afternoon: we need not detail the least impeccable features of the sleevemy sisters costume: now altogether lostthough I do retain, I am afraid, a certain affection for the contours of one particular flaw. The aunts, as you will have gathered, are absent from the photograph, such that we might subtract three hatsfar leftand forgo an explanation of the malady, often thought inconsequential, at any rate, and perhaps better termed an infirmity, if not simply a complaint of sorts, or merely a spell. The borderupper corner, rightdecapitates the lamppost, thereby depriving us of a brass pike: an ornamental measure, yes, or a slight disfigurementand likely an imposition for the crows. The scene may achieve a modest successtrees; grass; dirtbut how foolish it is, even so, to inquire as to the character of the insectstheir size or their varietytravelling hither and yon, just below the bottom of the frame. Rebecca Weisman,  , Single Channel HD Video, 2015 We return, then, to the edge of the image: scratches at the margin, in fact, and a stain in the form of an exclamation pointnow resembling, after all, a stick-figure fallen down, its limbs dwindled or shorn. Whereas a portrait in a Victorian house: superstition may explain the curious spaceseach of these, you see, the size of a child. While schoolroom portraits exhibit a false child, so-called, who stands in place of this boy or that: at home in his sickbed, for instance, or in repose beneath the hedgerow. Corpse portraitsrectangular or circular, rather than squarepaint the eyelids a bright white, reviving the child in swaddling clothes orneatly seated among his siblings, on the parlor chaisein a velvet suit. When the eyes are worn away entirely, however, over time, one is reminded of those ancient grotesques, stoned on the roadsideten across, in the storybookstheir faces having been erased by the wind. A portrait from the seventeenth centuryas hereprovides no account of the culprit, necessarily, though it does indicate the victimneither a fine likeness nor one most atrociouswith a faint mark above each shoulder. A half-moon is a guillotine, true, but also a handsome clasp, usually silver, and sometimes akin to a common hook-and-eye design: altogether proper, then, but insufficient, at least on this occasion, to affix the collar at the throat. An example from the eighteenth centurylater subject to the infelicities of a boning knifearrays the family against a red wall, beside a lattice window: six panes and a scheme of birdsnot easily mistaken, this, for a diagram of children dying. In 1953 or 1954, wintertime: the reflection devises a second child every afternoonyou may note the placement of the portrait, of course, and the height of the blindswhile certain of the garments grow new parts in the dark.  And so the collar becomes a vulture, sayor some beast even less agreeableafter the fashion of those so-called ghost photographs, wherein the gentleman, as a matter of ordinary courtesy, removes his head rather than his hat. Cabinet cardsGertrude, in a three-quarter view; Blanche, half-lengthdecorate the front room or the hallway, bent and cut, the scraps having become, soon enough, excellent little instruments for stifling a scream.   issues from   or, more precisely, a red pigment of the sort that inhabits the alphabet: medieval ornament, if you pleasethe vines always strangle the letter Ydarkening the parchment, goatskin and otherwise. Miniature portraits, however, collected and displayed by the Victorian mourner, offer no consolation at table, where they might be confused withamong other such items, furnished as the first coursedishes of tainted sprats.  The portrait on the lawn, late in the afternoon: we face east, it would seem, which surely explains the wrought-iron chairtoppled: lower corner, leftif not the hammer in the background, its handle painted a familiar shade of blue. Or, indeed, green, while the columnsquite an unpleasant effect, yesappear to bleed: the imprudent activity of a shadow, you might assume, or merely the encroachment of sunlightthough, in fact, it is already beginning to rain. The glass, split, makes a polite design, absent the knifeor a smaller article, likely something of Mothershidden, as it is, behind a simple figure, a rectangular form: just another colorbrownat the center of the frame.

I held my breath for twelve  long seconds and I didnt break  my stride. I am past the evening  at the dock, the fog descending  like white stallions. I am sitting  on the pier where you last sang  to your father before he sailed  into the mist, hoping you will  sing to me before I leave. I am  not afraid of the dark or the  blinding lights that come after.  It is the silence that terrifies me  like walking in a tunnel and you  scream   so, the  echo comforts you like a friend.

I do  not care for its women  and their brief love. I have  no sympathy for the woman  at the post office who mailed  her husband a love letter  addressed to another. Fuck  this city and its muddy lattes.  If I knew the woman in my  arms were married, I wouldnt  have reached for the music  in her mouth. From now on  I will board the first train to work.  I will take a rear-facing seat for  a chance that the train might travel  backwards into the city of my youth.  You will be waiting with the anger  that burned my book of sonnets. And  I will have nothing to offer you  besides the unsweetened tea  that I have come to like.  I love you is as true as a train  traveling into the past. I am  reaching, like the woman  at the post office reaching  into the collection box  for a letter she sent decades ago. Claudia Keep,  , 2020  watercolor on paper, 6 x 8 inches  Courtesy of the artist and MARCH. Killing a chicken seemed  an easy task for my mother  who has never butchered.  She pinned both wings  and claws under her feet,  ran a finger against the grain  of its feather to reveal the skin  of its neck. If the animal were  granted a word, it would say  please before my mother made  a small cut. She pressed its  tiny body until it stopped  throbbing under her palm.  The chicken came back  to life in a bowl of boiling  water meant to ease plucking  its feathers. It ran around  the kitchen in circles. Its head  drooped from where the knife  grazed its neck. My mother  rushed towards the door,  screaming in a manner I was  certain matched those who  saw Jesus walk out of his tomb.  I am a believer in the power  of hunger. My mother and  I ate drumsticks before we  bleached the kitchen floor.  Claudia Keep,  , 2022  oil on masonite panel, 10 x 8 inches  Courtesy of the artist and MARCH. For several hours in my bed,  I thought about the bartender  who told me she thinks she would  die soon. The few times she was  by the coast the tide rose over  the levee in rage she was tempted  to drive into it. She moved back  to the country for this. We were  strangers talking in a dwindling  bar and I hoped she would get  busy. I dont know more than  she told me. Last year she was  tortured in a room so white  it felt wrong to think of it  as a prison in Serbia where  she lived. I am not puzzled  by her delight to have come  home to her mother but my  fathers return years after  his closet space was cleaned  out. For many days, I did not  know what to say to him.  I thought he would stay gone. Ajibola Tolase is a Nigerian poet and essayist. He is a graduate of the MFA program at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
