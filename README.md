## Big Idea:
Using Google Vertex AI model(s) to recommend recently published literary pieces (short fiction, creative nonfiction, or interviews) published by a variety of small, independet or academic literary journals, to a wider audience is the goal of this project. What motivated this project is the sheer low numbers of  motivation is to increase the readership of literary journals by encouraging our app's users to click on interesting headlines to read the entire piece on the journal's website. 
We envision that  the users could use some filter words to narrow their search or our recommendations.
To recommend these pieces, we want to either classify each literary piece or to use AI to summarize it to no more than 10-15 words.
